china	On the day of delivery, I called me. I am really surprised. However, taking into account this is still quite good to drink, the income is much higher than the price you bought last time. After all, it was during the event. In the afternoon, I couldn't help but call Amazon. The customer service phone also found me for a long time. Understand that the original order of the province, rather than hacking, sleepwalking, I feel more relieved. Surprisingly, this wine came in time. Once my sad past of drinking on New Year's Day passed, I hadn’t had wine for a long time. When I received it, I still wanted to enjoy it as a drink. Did not expect so soon. About one week apart. Lost love. Sure enough, it was time to drink again. The wine tastes very good, not drunk or vomiting. Mixed colleagues' liqueurs and red wine. Wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep anymore, trying to drink water. In short, this is really more delicious than red wine and Likou.		port
china	It is very suitable for elderly people and their wives with poor drinking. = = The wife of an adult said that the feeling of drinking wine is very appetizing. Moreover, it does not require special sobering. The date of filling and the date of the cork on the label are not good enough. The year of brewing and the explanation of the brewing may not be correct. I do not know if it is because I do not know or why, one star is reduced...	date datetar	port

china	The bottle is very nice and the delivery is fast. When you plan to have a new year's dinner, you can drink and drink with your family who are not able to drink. The bottle is too small. Spike can buy 2 bottles just fine		port
china	I liked it. I always liked the taste and taste of Riesling. I bought two bottles. One of them was broken when it was received. Contacting customer service Amazon soon gave a return.		port
china	Excellent quality, excellent taste, very affordable prices, will buy again next time.		port
china	The bottle is exquisite, very beautiful, and the color is also very nice. For the first time, I like to drink white wine. The aroma is very liked. The astringency is really much better than the red wine, but I can't drink it but it's really fragrant! ! !		port

china	Taste is positive, the aroma is floating good things		port
china	I don’t drink much at ordinary times, but this town’s entrance is very good.		port
china	Did not drink it, but it looks good, and 66 to buy, buy it on the price increases		port
china	The taste is very good and the whole family loves it		port
china	A little bit less, knowing that the weight is small, it actually looks like this.		port
china	Give it away, the packaging is good, the taste does not know		port
china	The amount is less, the taste is lighter, and generally speaking		port
china	It's sweet, it's better than some of the red wine I had before.		port
china	Haven't opened yet. When you're ready for the New Year, try your sweet drink for the first time (yes?). Look at Amazon for this product. It's cheap and quality. Hopefully, there will be a surprise. PS: The packaging is too big, a bottle of this kind of big box that can hold 4 big bags of diapers		port
china	Such as title. Amazon put it as a treasure of the town shop, not that this cargo itself a lot of top grade. It should be praised for the price/performance ratio. The actual 4.5/5 points.		port
china	Eating seafood should be very suitable. The logistics was not so fast. A few days later, a large amount of bottle was worn. . Bottle closures have serious problems. . . But when you buy yourself, you don't mind. ! Not bad, it's worth buying. (The Americas will be better.)		port
china	The first time I drink this kind of wine, I feel like I'm drinking medicine.		port
china	Almost no sense of the body's level, not sweet enough, a bit sour, a little red		port
china	It is 13 years to come, and the details are 11 years.		port
china	This wine is very light, almost no sense of the level of the body, but no Riesling, especially after the fermentation of noble rot bacteria lingering after the taste of Riesling, not to mention the gas smell of German ice wine, even the flowers and fruits The incense is completely unobvious and can only be said. If you want dozens of pieces, you can try it.		port
china	"When I bought it, I didn't notice the words ""The year is for reference only..."". The difference with the picture received was a year. Vintage years also represent value. Did not drink, I do not know how to taste. Second thing 66 yuan, although the year is inconsistent, it is also worthwhile. Please draw attention to the fact that buying wine in the Amazon must see the year. This is already the second time that the wine is bought shorter than the picture."		port
china	No ice before drinking, almost no wine, only sweet taste, feeling very general, completely worth the price		port
china	It can be known from the label that this is a German sweet white of Pradikatswein (that is, QmP, the highest level of German wine), and it is the Auslese level in QmP. (Beerenauslese), Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein, which is known to everybody, yes, this Riesling is not ice wine, comrades who want to buy ice wine can bypass this sweet and sweet but not greasy. Unlike some low-quality sweet whites, sweet or sweet, this wine still feels a bit sour. The balance between sweet and sour is very good. It is not syrup that can be made with alcohol, 139 bottles. The price is also very cost-effective, this sweet white half bottle, the advantage is to open a bottle of absolute can drink, even if the amount of wine like me is not enough, then 750 milliliters, then you may not drink once on the fortress on the stopper This time, the taste of the wine will be greatly reduced, which is very good. As for the method of drinking this wine, I think it should be done before the meal to make an aperitif, or eat it with a dessert after the meal, (drinking more flavor on the ice cream Good), drinking temperature is around 5 degrees Good, all in all 139 bottles price is very cost-effective, it is recommended more than two bottles of Tuen at home. Think of a bottle QmP only 70, but also what bike it ~	creamflavor thin sweet round greasy sour	port
china	Do not understand the sweet way. Drinking advanced ice wine and expensive rot have their own advantages. In this context, it still feels that this German sweet white is worth noting. Will not die sweet, scented, there is a certain level. There is a slight sour afterwards - this does not count as a feature or as a disadvantage.		port

Amazon is not professional when it comes to selling alcohol. When you bought it, you didn't know what year it was. Is it also a good thing to sell wine in the US? The main thing here is to take care of Amazon's services. It's really not good. The speed of express delivery is fine, but it is not even downstairs.

china	This brand has played a lot of advertisements in recent years and is widely known. However, if you tell the truth at this price, you can buy a lot of better-tasting wines, Italian or French. Visible popularity does not represent taste and taste.		cabernet
china	Back label with a bar code is ugly and can't send people. When you buy it, it is Amazon's self-employed. When you look back at the link and become a third party, such a big company is doing it.		cabernet
china	Not the same as the whole box, even the red box is not, looking at self-buying, the result is the Shenzhen City Fair will e-commerce agent, does not look like real		cabernet
china	It takes a while to buy during a promotion. This price should be worth		cabernet
china	The taste is OK, a little astringent Cabernet Sauvignon, I personally like it.		cabernet

china	It doesn't feel good. I don't feel very much like genuine products.		cabernet
china	Last night, I opened the bottle and tasted this bottle of wine. The wine is definitely a real wine. Special apology to amazon. At the same time, we also hope that Amazon will provide complete product information: the name of the agent of the wine. Convenient customer inquiries.		cabernet
china	The 5 bottles of Penfolds 389 red wine purchased this time were distributed by the Obian traders, but they did not have the anti-counterfeit labels of Obian. There were some red wines purchased in the past. Please ask Amazon to give reasonable explanations, otherwise you will complain. ,Thank you!		cabernet
china	A total of four bottles were bought twice a week during the National Day last year and they were given to people and their own drink. The second time I arrived, I found that it was not an agent provided in the original picture, but a company in Shenzhen. Immediately contact Amazon customer service, answering the difference in packaging but the quality is certainly a problem. However, a few days later it was opened for drinking, and the wine is indeed not like real wine.		cabernet
china	Occasionally drink, it will be better to wake up for a long time. Slightly extravagant. Australia's famous Penfolds wine bin8		cabernet
china	It's also a good point to buy the same brand than before		cabernet
china	Thought it is the original wine, it is purchased overseas. Unfortunately, it is canned and there is no time for wine tasting; hope is genuine. Also hope that Amazon does not scold its own sign!		cabernet
china	I used to buy this wine at the Shenzhen Sam's Club. I knew that the wine tasted good and was inexpensive. I have come to Chengdu for a small stay. Since there is no Sam shop in Chengdu, I will go shopping on this platform for the first time. Because I believe in the Amazon shopping platform, I bought 6 bottles at a time. However, the taste of the wine is very disappointing, very sour, it is difficult to drink, it is difficult to drink the whole day after a hard day, can not be compared with the same type of wine in the Sam shop, want to return and afraid to get angry, can only throw the trash barrel. This time, he was deceived and will never be bought again.		cabernet
china	Having bought so many goods, Amazon is really good! Very good packaging, high pressure airbag protection, wine labels, packaging boxes, etc. are perfectly protected and indescribable. The outermost box was unscathed. I thought that the far-flung Beijing shipment was supposed to have no damage to the outer packaging or label of the wine. That's great! Thanks Amazon! ! !		cabernet
china	Buy 3 bottles to see the picture is Asc's goods to start, send what is Obian, please give a reasonable explanation, where is the reputation?		cabernet

china	Very good wine, soft entrance, good value for money		pinot noir port
china	The reason for the four stars is that my previous star rating was directly blocked? ? ! Is a good wine, that is, the seller's credit is not very good, we are the unit welfare wine, need an invoice, but also when buying, but there is no search.		
china	Like this! Fruity level is very rich, light body, very good!		
china	This is 138.00 red wine? ? ? ? ? ? Slag is not worth		
china	For new wines, tannins are slightly heavier. But awake a little in a cup and it's very good! This price is very good value, aroma is full, fruity, fruit acid levels are more abundant. Higher degree, a bottle in place!		
china	Not yet to drink, the production date is January 16, 2017, and my heart is a bit less.		
china	The packaging is very professional and delivery is awesome. The quality of the wine is also good, with a hundred or so positioning, praise!		
china	not good. Sour is not to say, there are shares of corrupted search.		
china	The taste of this wine is very good. Shopping here is more secure and was once deceived by Jingdong Global Purchases. Global purchase is not a department of Jingdong, but a small shop registered in Hong Kong.		port
china	The first time I bought items on Amazon, I looked very well. Not bad.		port
china	Original bottle imports, first purchase. We don’t taste wine, but we drink a little bit of blood every year for a good taste.		port
china	The packaging is very safe and will not break at all. The wine is worth a lot for this price. It's slightly sweet, and the taste is a little light. People who drink less often have easier access, heavier fruit and less aftertaste. However, 30 bottles of wine can be drawn down. what.		port
china	Very good, never to evaluate before, do not know how many points are wasted, now know that points can be exchanged for money, we must properly evaluate, and then I will copy this passage away, can earn points, but also save trouble, where to go Where to copy, the most important thing is, do not have serious comments, do not think how much worse, directly issued on it, recommend it to everyone!		port
china	The description is the same as the real thing. The authenticity is consistent with the taste and the price. It is worth a penny. Logistics arrived one day earlier than expected, praise!		port

china	Good, logistics on time, complete product packaging, quality in line with expectations! Praise!		port

china	Although the taste is thin and not so many levels, it is still much better than certain domestic solutions. Used for daily cost-effective consumption.		port
china	It tastes so good, not particularly good, the price is here		port
china	The tannins are more astringent, the taste is relatively simple, and the aftertaste is a bit rushing. The price of the second price may be outside the supermarket to buy similar products.		port
china	A taste of alcohol, like blended fake wine, regretted buying more		port
china	Soft and full taste, cost-effective, regardless of net drink or table, are good.		port
china	"Packing without COFCO's ""I buy a net"" is good, but the speed is fast, the taste of the wine is OK, and overall it is not bad"		port
china	The taste of this wine is very good according to the price, and the color is also acceptable. The packaging and distribution are very good, and they will be well received.		port

china	This is the second purchase, the first is the order number 3.1, sent to the box is very good, the color of the wine looked good, but the second purchase of the box is small, still bumpy feeling, wine Pour out feeling different from the first time, the color is very light, like against Sprite		port
china	This brand has good taste and feels good value for money.		port
china	A bottle down 30, really is better than the supermarket to sell 7 80 pieces of wine to drink, mouth pale slightly lighter, a box of 188 also sent opener wine stopper, really cost-effective, this box to continue to buy after drinking, is indeed hot on Amazon Sales, however, bought several boxes in a row, the sea horses knife disappeared, or wine plug is not, each time the purchase of packaging is worse than the last time, the earliest Amazon packaging, and now is directly the packaging of excellent red wine, loose Alas, it is estimated that there is no reason why the hippocampus does not have this knife.		port
china	Received red wine, the packaging is very strong. Receiving acceptance is complete, express attitude is very good. 198 hands to 6 packs. Good deal. Checked online to 286 yuan / support. I do not know whether it is true or false. It seems to be high-grade anyway. The seller's service likes one. Will come again next time. Disclaimer: I am not attentive at all.		port
china	I here in Zhejiang Yiwu, with the peak express, look at the express information, see is to go to Beijing. In times of worry, the goods arrived in time. The dispensers sent the bottle opener. The taste is not clear, ah, will not drink. Buy a wedding. Now calculate, it is really a lot of money to buy alcohol online than in the store.		port
china	The system showed that the delivery number 20-26 was actually sent to the 22nd, much earlier than expected. The wine has not been opened yet and no comments are made.		port
china	The wine tastes good, the bottle opener is very easy to use, and the pourer is also very fun. It was originally written for 7-10 days before the store was delivered. The store was also ahead of time and had a good experience.		port
china	It's still good. The first time I drank Italian red wine, the taste is OK.		port
china	It should be imported. Sticky translations aren't in place. At first glance they look like fake wine.		port
china	Good drink, cost-effective, bought 6 boxes of sellers to send me SF Express! Packed with a special red wine foam box, do not worry about damage. The service is also good. Before the ticket is issued, I specially call and communicate with me.		port
china	The taste is still very good, that is, grape taste lighter! !		port
china	If you like to drink red wine often, this taste is good. It is worth recommending.		port
china	Better than the supermarket to buy a lot of moderate concentration, not astringent is not light.		port
china	Packing meticulous, exquisite, taste and supermarket about 100 yuan, it is worth		port
china	Express, like one directly to the office, do not call one. Wine, worthy of the price ... ... a penny goods! Invoice not?		port
china	The express delivery speed was fast, and it was purchased on March 6 and arrived on the 10th. The courier moved to the 3rd floor and arrived at the door. The packaging box is intact and intact. After opening the package, a special bag and two bags were found. The seal was very good and airtight. The hand touched something like a tool, squeaking. After the knife was cut open, it looked like a broken bottle. There was no trace of wine, the cap was complete, and there were no traces of wine left on the plastic bag. Why send an empty bottle debris bag? Contact the seller by phone and return a bottle of money. But my heart is still pondering, which is worse? Open a bottle, drank, more mellow, dry and positive, aftertaste can be. The wine produced in 2015 is worth the money. More than 300 yuan more strong wine.		port
china	Yes, the degree is a bit high 13.5. It's good to drink. It's not a connoisseur. I don't know how to express it. I like it anyway.		port
china	After a long time, I chose this wine. I don't know too much about wine. I often drink it. I feel good. I basically buy it and I drink it slowly.		port
china	The logistics was not damaged soon. Although it felt slightly thinner, it was okay. It was disappointing to open the box. There were actually two bottles of labels that were not posted. It is hard to imagine this is a French wine produced by a Michelin star chef. The degree of strictness is extremely poor. There is reason to believe that this is most likely to be canned domestically. Seeing thirty dollars a bottle of French wine in the supermarket will not be such a package. I haven’t started drinking but I’ve already scored a big discount in my heart and don’t report much hope. In addition, we must confess about Amazon. The first time we buy things here, the products look very tall. However, the design experience of the website is too bad compared to Tmall. Even submitting a few pictures will have to be done. No wonder foreigners can't compete with Chinese people. The shopping experience is indeed not very good and cumbersome.		port
china	Star product, worth recommending. It's worth doing activities to buy.		port
china	Late delivery, because of the reasons for the New Year, red wine is still OK, mainly not too convincing!		port
china	I didn't drink any of my own bottle and I let my friends drink it.		port
china	After buying this wine three times, it's not as good as one time. This time, when you open the box, it's still uncovered. It's already opened. When you open it with a bottle opener, the cork will rot. It's very doubtful about this quality. ! Want a reasonable reply!		port
china	I thought I had bought good cheap goods for luck. As a result, when I received the goods, I only observed the appearance of the outer box. I opened the top carton in the inner package and found that there was no trace of leakage. In the evening, all the homes were unpacked. It was found that the inside of the outer packing box was two cartons above and below. The following one had a bottle of wine leaked inside, but there was no leaking through the outside of the packing box and it was completely invisible. At that time, a replacement request was sent. In the evening, I received the first reply and then sent photos and e-mails as requested. The result was no more. I contacted the customer service once during the phone call and said that there was a colleague who followed up. The result waited one week. 5 One business day, no phone call, no mail, no problem, extremely disappointing, and the Amazon that has blown up oil is just like this. Since then, we have also purchased membership services.		port
china	First of all, I don't understand the pros and cons of red wine. Because Amazon directs, so I chose this one. It is recommended to buy at home for a period of time (for half a year) and drink it again. Compare Joel Robuchon with Paul Jaboulet Ainé CÔTES DU RHÔNE. This taste will be a little worse. Buy, for this price point (taste) kill the same domestic price red wine.		port
china	Wine can be, the year received is 14 years. Buy it carefully!		port
china	A few days ago, I bought it once. Obviously the web page shows the 2010 wine, but after receiving the goods, it was in 2012. I called the phone and the customer service explained for a long time. Well, I will not say more in 2012. This time, it turned out to be 2015, but it was not wrong! ! ! !		port
china	Thumbs up! Fast logistics, good wine, simply beautiful and cheap!		port
china	It's worse than before. This batch was produced in 17 years		port
china	The price of wine is not as good as that of the Penfolds 389. However, this price is definitely more than a single taste. The fruit is rich and there is no bitterness.		port
china	The taste can be worth buying, the mother said to drink good night sleep		port
china	The packaging is so simple that no one touches it. When it is delivered, the carton is almost broken.		port
china	With fruity aromas, it's OK for more than 60 bottles/bottle.		port
china	Suspected of fraudulent consumer behavior, the last purchase of a box (6 bottles), drinking well, want to buy again, in the 'My Order' that call the order, point to buy again, to the bottle of the link, the price is also Basically the same, after the freight arrives, it is found that it is not the same as the purchase, contact customer service, explain the situation, customer service does not give a solution.		port
china	The wine received this morning, tasted the next, the taste is OK, value for money, October 6, 2015 production, saying that doing something so cheap, there are reasons why, when the order is still thinking about will not It will be 2012, but it's also the case. The price is decided, entry level table wine		port
china	Yes, I like this kind of taste, and it is quite reasonable to engage in activities and activities. It is suitable for daily meals.		port
china	I haven’t tasted it after I bought it. I recently opened 2 bottles. The wine tastes good!		port
china	The picture was in 2011 and it was sent in 2014. Is this fraud? Before returning home, the family drank a bottle, or else it must be returned		port
china	The taste is too rough, the hair is astringent, and the color is dark. Because it is Amazon's direct purchase, it also has good value for money. In fact, it is 100% wine on the market.		port
china	After drinking it dry mouth, this price should also be like this		port
china	This price level, in addition to packaging, all the value		port
china	The cork is a full length of cork that is longer than usual. It costs 4 stars at the time of purchase, and has a total rating of 5 stars.		port
china	The company had dinner and drank, boys and girls loved it, needed to sober up, sober up, three hundred six pieces, but also want to sample, five-star!		port
china	The advertisement advertised was the 2014 wine, and the invoice received was also 2014, but the logo on the bottle was in 2013. This wine is obviously in the domestic OEM, buyers, true and false merits of self-defense it.		port
china	This is the second time to buy. The last time it was really good. This time the wine was not fake or the wine merchant was badly stored.		port
china	Must be bad oh, bought a few times, before it was quite good, this time missed the night and missed the night! Too disappointed.		port
china	MUSCAT is originally a dessert, suitable for dessert. But see the introduction of alcohol content of 15%. How can such a high alcoholic wine be so sweet? Is it wrong to write alcohol?		port
china	To sober up, hang up, and hang up, you must wake up for a long time before you can enjoy the richness and complexity of this wine. In July in Guangzhou, the temperature was around 33 degrees. Noon took it out of the thermostat and just smelled the scent, but it tasted bitterly. Put it back into the wine cooler. After an hour, it was still bitter. He drank 1/3 of the lunch and put it back in the wine cabinet. In the evening, it is still bitter. Where is Amazon's ‘sweet and supple’ taste? Is this wine already over the period of drinking, or is it not enough to save improper wine quality? At noon the next day, it was still bitter. At night, I had no taste of bitterness. I finally felt its richness and complexity. It was indeed a good wine. But this time it was almost finished, only about 100ml left, most bottles of wine are paid tuition, huh, huh. It seems that this wine has a certain amount of aging potential. The town shop price of 1098 bought a box, there are 5 bottles, keep slowly drinking. Speaking of strong and strong wine, it is still unforgettable that the Italian Classical Conte bottle Pope Claremont VII Collector's Edition is only half the price of Pope Newcastle, but no less, but unfortunately it is out of stock.		port
china	General, not hanging cup, astringent, may not sober enough		port
china	For half an hour of sobering, chestnuts and oak are aromas with a hint of creamy aroma. High cost performance		port
china	The wine is good, it's good, and the packaging is cool.		port
china	The first time I wrote a comment, this time it was too disappointing. What is the situation with the label posted?		port
china	The website shopping guide picture is the wine picked in 2012, and the picked wine was sent in 2014. Amazon also learned to fool. I wouldn't retreat if I drank myself. I would have believed in Amazon, but now I have to beware of it.		port
china	It is doubtful that Michelin Samsung will use this kind of wine and be cheated. It is estimated that it will be used for cooking.		port
china	Year 2011 Received 2013 on the web. French wine, 2013 is a bad year! To sell red wine, Amazon should pay attention to the year!		port
china	Very good red wine, slightly acidic entrance, need to sober for half an hour better entrance		port
china	The degree of alcoholicity is 13%, and the arrival rate is 12.5%. Don't know how it is?		port
china	Alcohol is a bit high, and the stopper is too easy to break into pieces and fall into the bottle.		port
china	In 2014, the taste was very good. The taste was good and the alcohol was not high. Awesome dry red		port
china	Value for money! Dry mouth excellent! worth buying!		port
china	The taste is very light, the color is not, the smell is more rushed, once bought onehope better than this!		port
china	This wine bottle has a special grade and it doesn't feel that heavy		port
china	Purchased before eleventh, I would like to drink the whole family in the evening of Mid-Autumn Festival. As a result, the taste is not welcome. The main problem is that the smoking time is at least 45 minutes; there is very little tannin; there is a spicy taste; there is hardly any aftertaste. There are 5 bottles, do not know how to deal with it!		port
china	I heard that this wine is a table wine for Shanghai Michelin restaurant. It should be good.		port
china	First of all, I don't understand the pros and cons of red wine. Because Amazon directs, so I chose this one. It is advisable to buy at home for a while (for half a year) to drink again. This taste is better than Joel Robuchon Paul Jaboulet Ainé VENTOUX. This price point ((feeling)) spikes the domestic same price red wine.		port
china	The packaging is broken. Fortunately, there is no problem with the wine. Drink a bottle, mellow taste, long aftertaste, high cost!		port
china	Although there are some small details when receiving the goods, the service of the customer service is definitely worth studying for each e-commerce service.		port
china	Good value for money Usually casually drink very good		port
china	Has been purchased many times, the wine is very good, the price is very high, worth recommending, the logistics will soon		port
china	Did not drink yet, after tasting. The poor attitude of logistics services was directly given to the district supermarkets, which was far worse than Jingdong's services.		port
china	Consistent with the description. Apart from being damaged by outsourcing, everything else is good. The quality of the wine is good		port
china	Not the original bottle, sour taste, light weight, like fake wine blended out.		port
china	Did not drink too much good wine, but it feels good.		port
china	I bought two boxes, one box for our family and one box for my parents. Spring Festival relatives and friends come to drink and lively! And this is very good taste, the bottle is also very beautiful! It's fun to put in the wine cooler! Haha		port
china	How did you send in 2013 when the website was written in 2012?		port
china	Town shop treasure special offer to buy ~ 318 cost effective worth the price, but the feeling should be domestic filling		port
china	320 price is very affordable, cost is very high! ! !		port
china	Produced in 2013 and canned in 2016. Subcontractual singles 80.		port
china	Engaged in activities 319 bottles to buy, this price is really good, do not understand red wine, but more than 100 bottles of domestic supermarkets to drink, not astringent, aftertaste spicy. Women and men drink well and they are not embarrassed. Buy less, buy some more if you are active.		port
china	Scattered on the Amazon bought some kinds of red wine, only this one is impressive. Because of the aroma, the hangover is good after half an hour.		port
china	After the six bottles of wine were opened, two bottles of bottles were found to be leaking. Generally, the problem was not found in wine stoppers, indicating that the wine was in contact with air at any time and was oxidized at any time. The taste changed immediately.		port
china	The packaging of the wine is very simple and stylish. The wine is very rich, but it does not feel much special.		port
china	The amazon logistics is really powerful. We will arrive in the morning after the order is placed in the morning and it will be well packed and delivered home. Red wine will be evaluated after drinking.		port
china	The alcohol concentration is also a bit high for me.		port
china	I have to drink it for a long time. The taste is very sour.		port
china	Several wines bought in the Amazon during the Chinese New Year. This drink is the most comfortable and has a stronger fragrance!		port
china	What I saw was worth buying and pushing. I thought it was pretty good to smash a bottle. The result was so disappointing that I only looked back at Amazon’s comments. It wasn’t me who had fallen pit.		port
china	Cork is easy to break, there is viscose in the bottle, there is sediment in the wine (not in tartar), it feels bad wine		port
china	Woke up for half an hour and came back. After coming back, I became vinegar. Wake up for half an hour before roommates tasted it and said it was good		port
china	Make do, see Samsung in the price share can not be more		port
china	It has a wonderful taste that does not match the new wine, full of mellow and fruity flavor. The entrance is easy and the sourness is not obvious.		port
china	The packaging is very good, not broken. However, the sign of entering into the back is not seen, it should be domestic filling, not the original bottle imported. The Riesling purchased at the same time has an import sign.		port
china	Production date 20130715, spike 1469 yuan, worried that the wine will break out of the box inspection, which 6 bottles of wine is like the packaging of eggs, originally intended to send Mid-Autumn Festival, but the box has posted invoices and packages do not remove the seal, and no Outer packaging This is the reason for deduction!		port
china	Just to hear the traffic station recommended this product, or what Samsung recommended Michelin, decisively started to buy. Husband said to drink well		port
china	There is a bottle of leakage actually refuse to deal with, really garbage!		port
china	Buy a box, did not come out of the box after delivery, and later found a bottle less, Amazon management is poor!		port
china	It's a bit acidic and it will be much better to wake up. This price is still possible.		port
china	"Turning from his wife's comment: ""Slightly bitter taste"", after all, women still like the sweet feeling. For Sangsu, who is a dark beer drinker, I like to feel more comfortable after entering the throat. Alcohol levels are fine for male players and slightly greater for ladies."		port
china	If you are not a professional, let’s say it tastes slightly sour. The entrance is ok. The price is still not good for the red devil.		port
china	It is worth the price, the tannins are very supple, the flavor is very strong, and the family loves it!		port
china	Not very knowledgeable about red wine, drinking a small cup before going to bed every day, good for health		port
china	Very good wine, always buying, very good entrance. . . . Those buyers who commented that the year was wrong, please come home to improve their knowledge of red wine, the vintage of the wine is always updated, how could it always be the 2011 wine, I was drunk		port
china	The reason for the four stars is that my previous star rating was directly blocked? ? ! Is a good wine, that is, the seller's credit is not very good, we are the unit welfare wine, need an invoice, but also when buying, but there is no search.		
china	Like this! Fruity level is very rich, light body, very good!		
china	This is 138.00 red wine? ? ? ? ? ? Slag is not worth		
china	For new wines, tannins are slightly heavier. But awake a little in a cup and it's very good! This price is very good value, aroma is full, fruity, fruit acid levels are more abundant. Higher degree, a bottle in place!		
china	Not yet to drink, the production date is January 16, 2017, and my heart is a bit less.		
china	The packaging is very professional and delivery is awesome. The quality of the wine is also good, with a hundred or so positioning, praise!		
china	not good. Sour is not to say, there are shares of corrupted search.		
china	The express delivery speed was fast, and it was purchased on March 6 and arrived on the 10th. The courier moved to the 3rd floor and arrived at the door. The packaging box is intact and intact. After opening the package, a special bag and two bags were found. The seal was very good and airtight. The hand touched something like a tool, squeaking. After the knife was cut open, it looked like a broken bottle. There was no trace of wine, the cap was complete, and there were no traces of wine left on the plastic bag. Why send an empty bottle debris bag? Contact the seller by phone and return a bottle of money. But my heart is still pondering, which is worse? Open a bottle, drank, more mellow, dry and positive, aftertaste can be. The wine produced in 2015 is worth the money. More than 300 yuan more strong wine.		port
china	Yes, the degree is a bit high 13.5. It's good to drink. It's not a connoisseur. I don't know how to express it. I like it anyway.		port
china	After a long time, I chose this wine. I don't know too much about wine. I often drink it. I feel good. I basically buy it and I drink it slowly.		port
china	The logistics was not damaged soon. Although it felt slightly thinner, it was okay. It was disappointing to open the box. There were actually two bottles of labels that were not posted. It is hard to imagine this is a French wine produced by a Michelin star chef. The degree of strictness is extremely poor. There is reason to believe that this is most likely to be canned domestically. Seeing thirty dollars a bottle of French wine in the supermarket will not be such a package. I haven’t started drinking but I’ve already scored a big discount in my heart and don’t report much hope. In addition, we must confess about Amazon. The first time we buy things here, the products look very tall. However, the design experience of the website is too bad compared to Tmall. Even submitting a few pictures will have to be done. No wonder foreigners can't compete with Chinese people. The shopping experience is indeed not very good and cumbersome.		port
china	Star product, worth recommending. It's worth doing activities to buy.		port
china	Late delivery, because of the reasons for the New Year, red wine is still OK, mainly not too convincing!		port
china	I didn't drink any of my own bottle and I let my friends drink it.		port
china	After buying this wine three times, it's not as good as one time. This time, when you open the box, it's still uncovered. It's already opened. When you open it with a bottle opener, the cork will rot. It's very doubtful about this quality. ! Want a reasonable reply!		port
china	I thought I had bought good cheap goods for luck. As a result, when I received the goods, I only observed the appearance of the outer box. I opened the top carton in the inner package and found that there was no trace of leakage. In the evening, all the homes were unpacked. It was found that the inside of the outer packing box was two cartons above and below. The following one had a bottle of wine leaked inside, but there was no leaking through the outside of the packing box and it was completely invisible. At that time, a replacement request was sent. In the evening, I received the first reply and then sent photos and e-mails as requested. The result was no more. I contacted the customer service once during the phone call and said that there was a colleague who followed up. The result waited one week. 5 One business day, no phone call, no mail, no problem, extremely disappointing, and the Amazon that has blown up oil is just like this. Since then, we have also purchased membership services.		port
china	First of all, I don't understand the pros and cons of red wine. Because Amazon directs, so I chose this one. It is recommended to buy at home for a period of time (for half a year) and drink it again. Compare Joel Robuchon with Paul Jaboulet Ainé CÔTES DU RHÔNE. This taste will be a little worse. Buy, for this price point (taste) kill the same domestic price red wine.		port
china	Wine can be, the year received is 14 years. Buy it carefully!		port
china	A few days ago, I bought it once. Obviously the web page shows the 2010 wine, but after receiving the goods, it was in 2012. I called the phone and the customer service explained for a long time. Well, I will not say more in 2012. This time, it turned out to be 2015, but it was not wrong! ! ! !		port
china	Thumbs up! Fast logistics, good wine, simply beautiful and cheap!		port
china	It's worse than before. This batch was produced in 17 years		port
china	The price of wine is not as good as that of the Penfolds 389. However, this price is definitely more than a single taste. The fruit is rich and there is no bitterness.		port
china	The taste can be worth buying, the mother said to drink good night sleep		port
china	The packaging is so simple that no one touches it. When it is delivered, the carton is almost broken.		port
china	With fruity aromas, it's OK for more than 60 bottles/bottle.		port
china	Suspected of fraudulent consumer behavior, the last purchase of a box (6 bottles), drinking well, want to buy again, in the 'My Order' that call the order, point to buy again, to the bottle of the link, the price is also Basically the same, after the freight arrives, it is found that it is not the same as the purchase, contact customer service, explain the situation, customer service does not give a solution.		port
china	The wine received this morning, tasted the next, the taste is OK, value for money, October 6, 2015 production, saying that doing something so cheap, there are reasons why, when the order is still thinking about will not It will be 2012, but it's also the case. The price is decided, entry level table wine		port
china	Yes, I like this kind of taste, and it is quite reasonable to engage in activities and activities. It is suitable for daily meals.		port
china	I haven’t tasted it after I bought it. I recently opened 2 bottles. The wine tastes good!		port
china	The picture was in 2011 and it was sent in 2014. Is this fraud? Before returning home, the family drank a bottle, or else it must be returned		port
china	The taste is too rough, the hair is astringent, and the color is dark. Because it is Amazon's direct purchase, it also has good value for money. In fact, it is 100% wine on the market.		port
china	After drinking it dry mouth, this price should also be like this		port
china	This price level, in addition to packaging, all the value		port
china	The cork is a full length of cork that is longer than usual. It costs 4 stars at the time of purchase, and has a total rating of 5 stars.		port
china	The company had dinner and drank, boys and girls loved it, needed to sober up, sober up, three hundred six pieces, but also want to sample, five-star!		port
china	The advertisement advertised was the 2014 wine, and the invoice received was also 2014, but the logo on the bottle was in 2013. This wine is obviously in the domestic OEM, buyers, true and false merits of self-defense it.		port
china	This is the second time to buy. The last time it was really good. This time the wine was not fake or the wine merchant was badly stored.		port
china	Must be bad oh, bought a few times, before it was quite good, this time missed the night and missed the night! Too disappointed.		port
china	MUSCAT is originally a dessert, suitable for dessert. But see the introduction of alcohol content of 15%. How can such a high alcoholic wine be so sweet? Is it wrong to write alcohol?		port
china	To sober up, hang up, and hang up, you must wake up for a long time before you can enjoy the richness and complexity of this wine. In July in Guangzhou, the temperature was around 33 degrees. Noon took it out of the thermostat and just smelled the scent, but it tasted bitterly. Put it back into the wine cooler. After an hour, it was still bitter. He drank 1/3 of the lunch and put it back in the wine cabinet. In the evening, it is still bitter. Where is Amazon's ‘sweet and supple’ taste? Is this wine already over the period of drinking, or is it not enough to save improper wine quality? At noon the next day, it was still bitter. At night, I had no taste of bitterness. I finally felt its richness and complexity. It was indeed a good wine. But this time it was almost finished, only about 100ml left, most bottles of wine are paid tuition, huh, huh. It seems that this wine has a certain amount of aging potential. The town shop price of 1098 bought a box, there are 5 bottles, keep slowly drinking. Speaking of strong and strong wine, it is still unforgettable that the Italian Classical Conte bottle Pope Claremont VII Collector's Edition is only half the price of Pope Newcastle, but no less, but unfortunately it is out of stock.		port
china	General, not hanging cup, astringent, may not sober enough		port
china	For half an hour of sobering, chestnuts and oak are aromas with a hint of creamy aroma. High cost performance		port
china	The wine is good, it's good, and the packaging is cool.		port
china	The first time I wrote a comment, this time it was too disappointing. What is the situation with the label posted?		port
china	The website shopping guide picture is the wine picked in 2012, and the picked wine was sent in 2014. Amazon also learned to fool. I wouldn't retreat if I drank myself. I would have believed in Amazon, but now I have to beware of it.		port
china	It is doubtful that Michelin Samsung will use this kind of wine and be cheated. It is estimated that it will be used for cooking.		port
china	Year 2011 Received 2013 on the web. French wine, 2013 is a bad year! To sell red wine, Amazon should pay attention to the year!		port
china	Very good red wine, slightly acidic entrance, need to sober for half an hour better entrance		port
china	The degree of alcoholicity is 13%, and the arrival rate is 12.5%. Don't know how it is?		port
china	Alcohol is a bit high, and the stopper is too easy to break into pieces and fall into the bottle.		port
china	In 2014, the taste was very good. The taste was good and the alcohol was not high. Awesome dry red		port
china	Value for money! Dry mouth excellent! worth buying!		port
china	The taste is very light, the color is not, the smell is more rushed, once bought onehope better than this!		port
china	This wine bottle has a special grade and it doesn't feel that heavy		port
china	Purchased before eleventh, I would like to drink the whole family in the evening of Mid-Autumn Festival. As a result, the taste is not welcome. The main problem is that the smoking time is at least 45 minutes; there is very little tannin; there is a spicy taste; there is hardly any aftertaste. There are 5 bottles, do not know how to deal with it!		port
china	I heard that this wine is a table wine for Shanghai Michelin restaurant. It should be good.		port
china	First of all, I don't understand the pros and cons of red wine. Because Amazon directs, so I chose this one. It is advisable to buy at home for a while (for half a year) to drink again. This taste is better than Joel Robuchon Paul Jaboulet Ainé VENTOUX. This price point ((feeling)) spikes the domestic same price red wine.		port
china	The packaging is broken. Fortunately, there is no problem with the wine. Drink a bottle, mellow taste, long aftertaste, high cost!		port
china	Although there are some small details when receiving the goods, the service of the customer service is definitely worth studying for each e-commerce service.		port
china	Good value for money Usually casually drink very good		port
china	Has been purchased many times, the wine is very good, the price is very high, worth recommending, the logistics will soon		port
china	Did not drink yet, after tasting. The poor attitude of logistics services was directly given to the district supermarkets, which was far worse than Jingdong's services.		port
china	Consistent with the description. Apart from being damaged by outsourcing, everything else is good. The quality of the wine is good		port
china	Not the original bottle, sour taste, light weight, like fake wine blended out.		port
china	Did not drink too much good wine, but it feels good.		port
china	I bought two boxes, one box for our family and one box for my parents. Spring Festival relatives and friends come to drink and lively! And this is very good taste, the bottle is also very beautiful! It's fun to put in the wine cooler! Haha		port
china	How did you send in 2013 when the website was written in 2012?		port
china	Town shop treasure special offer to buy ~ 318 cost effective worth the price, but the feeling should be domestic filling		port
china	320 price is very affordable, cost is very high! ! !		port
china	Produced in 2013 and canned in 2016. Subcontractual singles 80.		port
china	Engaged in activities 319 bottles to buy, this price is really good, do not understand red wine, but more than 100 bottles of domestic supermarkets to drink, not astringent, aftertaste spicy. Women and men drink well and they are not embarrassed. Buy less, buy some more if you are active.		port
china	Scattered on the Amazon bought some kinds of red wine, only this one is impressive. Because of the aroma, the hangover is good after half an hour.		port
china	After the six bottles of wine were opened, two bottles of bottles were found to be leaking. Generally, the problem was not found in wine stoppers, indicating that the wine was in contact with air at any time and was oxidized at any time. The taste changed immediately.		port
china	The packaging of the wine is very simple and stylish. The wine is very rich, but it does not feel much special.		port
china	The amazon logistics is really powerful. We will arrive in the morning after the order is placed in the morning and it will be well packed and delivered home. Red wine will be evaluated after drinking.		port
china	The alcohol concentration is also a bit high for me.		port
china	I have to drink it for a long time. The taste is very sour.		port
china	Several wines bought in the Amazon during the Chinese New Year. This drink is the most comfortable and has a stronger fragrance!		port
china	What I saw was worth buying and pushing. I thought it was pretty good to smash a bottle. The result was so disappointing that I only looked back at Amazon’s comments. It wasn’t me who had fallen pit.		port
china	Cork is easy to break, there is viscose in the bottle, there is sediment in the wine (not in tartar), it feels bad wine		port
china	Woke up for half an hour and came back. After coming back, I became vinegar. Wake up for half an hour before roommates tasted it and said it was good		port
china	Make do, see Samsung in the price share can not be more		port
china	It has a wonderful taste that does not match the new wine, full of mellow and fruity flavor. The entrance is easy and the sourness is not obvious.		port
china	The packaging is very good, not broken. However, the sign of entering into the back is not seen, it should be domestic filling, not the original bottle imported. The Riesling purchased at the same time has an import sign.		port
china	Production date 20130715, spike 1469 yuan, worried that the wine will break out of the box inspection, which 6 bottles of wine is like the packaging of eggs, originally intended to send Mid-Autumn Festival, but the box has posted invoices and packages do not remove the seal, and no Outer packaging This is the reason for deduction!		port
china	Just to hear the traffic station recommended this product, or what Samsung recommended Michelin, decisively started to buy. Husband said to drink well		port
china	There is a bottle of leakage actually refuse to deal with, really garbage!		port
china	Buy a box, did not come out of the box after delivery, and later found a bottle less, Amazon management is poor!		port
china	It's a bit acidic and it will be much better to wake up. This price is still possible.		port
china	"Turning from his wife's comment: ""Slightly bitter taste"", after all, women still like the sweet feeling. For Sangsu, who is a dark beer drinker, I like to feel more comfortable after entering the throat. Alcohol levels are fine for male players and slightly greater for ladies."		port
china	If you are not a professional, let’s say it tastes slightly sour. The entrance is ok. The price is still not good for the red devil.		port
china	It is worth the price, the tannins are very supple, the flavor is very strong, and the family loves it!		port
china	Not very knowledgeable about red wine, drinking a small cup before going to bed every day, good for health		port
china	Very good wine, always buying, very good entrance. . . . Those buyers who commented that the year was wrong, please come home to improve their knowledge of red wine, the vintage of the wine is always updated, how could it always be the 2011 wine, I was drunk		port
china	First of all, I don't understand the pros and cons of red wine. Because Amazon directs, so I chose this one. It is recommended to buy at home for a period of time (for half a year) and drink it again. Compare Joel Robuchon with Paul Jaboulet Ainé CÔTES DU RHÔNE. This taste will be a little worse.

china	Must be bad oh, bought a few times, before it was quite good, this time missed the night and missed the night! Too disappointed.		port
china	This is a good price. Fall in love with dry red. Drink a little bit every night. This wine is still good. Event price 99 is a good deal. But by comparison, I still prefer Chile and Australia wine! Cheap and cost-effective!		port
china	After a long time, I chose this wine. I don't know too much about wine. I often drink it. I feel good. I basically buy it and I drink it slowly.		port

china	Very good table wine Sweet aftertaste When the wine is open, the wine comes out. I didn't just drink it to evaluate.		port
china	Collection! It should be good, because it is an old Amazon customer, so absolutely trust! Do you say that if you buy foreign stuff, do you find a domestic agent or a foreign company?嘿嘿		port
china	According to the online method, it wasn't alcohol blending. Buy it for my mother, she said.		port

Speaking of strong and strong wine, it is still unforgettable that the Italian Classical Conte bottle Pope Claremont VII Collector's Edition is only half the price of Pope Newcastle, but no less, but unfortunately it is out of stock.		port
china	I bought Mong Kok, I also bought this, and tried to open two drinks at the same time. This wine does have its truth more than an expensive person. Indeed, it is fragrant when opening a bottle. I go to the entrance and wake up for a certain time. After the feeling, are slightly thicker than the degree of exuberance. Spike price buy is worth recommending.		port

china	The chef's wine, before drinking in his Hong Kong restaurant was very good, and the price is similar to Hong Kong.		port
china	A young blend of wines produced in France but different from traditional French wines. The first tasting of the wines of Gwanghe and Syrah was of a medium-bodied, dark ruby ​​red color. The taste is my favorite acidity and shows a younger fruit aroma. The depth of the traditional French wine is less, and the freshness of a New World wine is more than three seconds. More than a hundred pieces can still be started, and more is not worth the price. Want to taste fresh friends can taste the next.		port
china	It's too sweet to drink It's hard to perceive a sensation of sweetness. It can only give 3 stars. The pressure of life is huge. You can only drink alcohol every night and paralyze yourself to improve the quality of sleep. . . . . This wine is like a drink		port
china	Logistics did not say so fast. When I arrived, I estimated that the car was air-conditioned. The bottle was warm. not good. Drink Castelberger's dry red first, then taste the wine. Obviously thick, heavy, tannins are not heavy. I like		port
china	It was really the first time I bought dry white, but it was still musky, and I thought it was very interesting to buy four bottles. The bottles are very nice, and I feel that the wine is definitely good, I haven’t tasted it, and I’m not disappointed.		port
china	If the shipment batch causes inconsistent manufacturing years, it is recommended to code the year on the product image and prompt it in a prominent location. The picture was marked in 2011, but it was received in 2015/3 months. All of them are not worth mentioning. Others are all good.		port
china	After returning home to see the first courier is very professional and very punctual. Secondly, the store is very careful to do a lot of shredded packaging. The only doubt is why the bottle out of the package can rotate 360 ​​degrees? Is it secondary filling?		port
china	The texture of the bottle is excellent, the bottle stopper is also very particular about the price, and the price I think is acceptable, I plan to drink some to stay some, and later this kind of event will continue to participate in		port
china	The tannins are heavier and of course it is a good meal with steak.		port
china	As the netizens said, tannins are good for me. I like such deep wine! Open the cork, the fruit flavor is strong, if not particularly picky, this wine is still good, the cost is relatively high		port
china	This wine is not good. After nearly one hour of sobering, the alcoholic taste is still flushed! It may be because it is the worst wine in this series. This price can buy domestic wine! The sobering time should be longer, at least two or three hours, and when you drink the second bottle, you can find that if the sobering time is longer, the wine can still be.		port
china	Not very wine tasting, want to buy red wine, just look at the introduction of this election, I feel pretty good, refreshing taste, a touch of sour, more oxidation will be better.		port
china	No loss is a high-end starter wine, or very good, after the entrance there is a slight sour, swallowing back to Gan		port
china	For the price, this is not bad at all. Given it's from Chile (which enjoys a privileged import tariff compared to european wines) the quality is slightly higer than eu wine for the same low price		port

china	Can not say that expensive red wine is a good wine, foreign wine prices are not high, and now is not the era of profits. Taste Carmena, rich in taste, really feel the taste of chocolate and tobacco, is a good red wine. However, if the packaging can be improved, it will be better. The packaging is a bit rough. Before drinking, people feel that they do not know whether it is inferior or not. This is a little suggestion as a consumer feels from the heart. I also look forward to taste the taste of Syrah.	tobaccorich chocolate	port
china	Carmena is indeed as stocky odor as other netizens have commented on. He is very disappointed.		port
china	Feel light, accustomed to Cabernet Sauvignon. The price is cheap		port

china	Satisfied with the goods, although the outer packaging was wet with rain, there was no effect.		port
china	Did not drink yet. . . . . The packaging is in place.		port
china	It was a blended paper towel that tried out a circle of red outside, white, non-uniform diffusion, poor quality of blending, and drinking.		port
china	Sure enough, no good goods are cheaper. The tastes of the seventy to eighties of Amazon’s direct operation are very different. After the 50’s and the non-directly operated ones, they did not dare to try it easily.		port
china	Very good wine, the price is not high, more than twice as expensive.		port
china	Before he bought two fire pit gardens in his home, it was said that the quality and price of wine was good, but this time it was really bad. What a strange smell, and there was something stinky even if it was an activity Can only do it! Your family is selling and quality is not guaranteed.		port

china	Slightly astringent, fruity, this price is worth it		port
china	My LP likes to drink some wine. I used to buy alcohol at the mall. I tried it without buying it on Amazon. I didn't expect LP to be full of praise after drinking it.		port
china	After receiving the goods can not wait to open the taste, good taste! Easy entrance! Worth recommending, inexpensive		port
china	Just want to experience what Carmeline is like, open a bottle and drink well		port
china	He bought his father and he drank well. Express delivery is very satisfactory.		port

china	The quality is very good, exactly the same as the description of the seller, very satisfied, really like		chardonnay port
china	One by one, this wine is really good ~ not sour, very supple, more than half an hour sober. It is highly recommended that it is a bit expensive to miss the event.		chardonnay port
china	Haven't opened the bottle, like the brand, and come back later to comment. Buy 2 bottles of Carmeni, 2015, a rare wine at this price! When I engage in activities, I will make a lot of stocks.		chardonnay port
china	Those who bought and sent to friends had been drunk before, worth the price.		chardonnay port
china	Special purchase, high cost performance, good Shiraz, balance, good entrance		chardonnay port
china	The wine has not been drunk and the packaging is intact. I hope to have a surprise.		chardonnay port
china	The body is mellow, the taste is rich and the price is cheaper than others		chardonnay port
china	Marquis Merlot's entrance is very mellow and worthy of the New World wine boutique.		chardonnay port
china	Very good, very good value, but unfortunately out of stock		chardonnay port
china	Cabernet Sauvignon saves a bit longer than Merlot, good wine, but not drink		chardonnay port
china	In terms of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the impression given by Cabernet Sauvignon is particularly direct. The iconic taste, although not surprising, has no shortcomings and is overall satisfactory; in comparison, Syrah is inferior. More than that, the texture is ambiguous, and the middle taste is almost plain boiled water. The taste is thin and flat, and Shiraz is disappointing!		chardonnay port
china	I seem to have engaged in activities to buy, bought two bottles, only sent a bottle, go back and check the order, the above is the number actually turned into a bottle, can not be reconciled, there is a re-buy the other, but also set two bottles Which is still a bottle, and then my order will be changed from two bottles into a bottle, what should I do?		chardonnay port
china	I missed one z second and I couldn't make it into one. The color of the wine was li-colored. I just poured it out and shaken slowly. I could smell some strong fruit (no alcohol taste, I couldn't tell what the taste was). After the sobering, the entrance I can feel some aromas around the tongue, you and I deserve it.		chardonnay port
china	OK! I never rated it before, I don't know how many points have been wasted. Now I know that points can be exchanged for money. I have to evaluate it well. Later, I copied the passage away. I can earn points, save trouble, and where to go. , directly issued on it, recommend it to everyone! !		chardonnay port
china	The taste was excellent. I had nearly 20 types of dried red wine below 300 RMB. There were domestic, New World and Old World. This was the best I had ever felt.		chardonnay port
china	Marquis red wine has been several, especially like Pinot Noir, is a cork; activity price 168.5, worth recommending.		chardonnay port
china	This wine is often eaten in South America a few years ago. The taste is pure and worth recommending.		chardonnay port
china	This medium-bodied wine is medium-bodied, with no bones and bitterness. It's worth more than 200! Originally there were some hopes for Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, and several different trials. It seems that Cabernet Sauvignon in Chile is not as good as Napa, but the quality of American wine is not uniform and it is not easy to master. Bordeaux has been fried. Did not cost too early, personal feeling or Coonawarra's Cabernet Sauvignon is the most cost-effective.		chardonnay port
china	149 start, affordable, overall service is good, but the only drawback is: grape harvesting is 14 years, 15 years filling, this and 10 may not be comparable.		chardonnay port
china	The year of the bottle of red wine that had dried Cabernet Sauvignon was 2013. I have no problem with the quality of the goods, but I had to confess to the delivery staff, saying that I had to go downstairs for delivery in the evening, and fear that other goods would be stolen. I said that I did not have a solution. At the end of the day, the delivery staff reluctantly sent them in. Finally, they paid for the unpacking inspection. This level of service is really incomparable with JD. No wonder YMX is getting mixed up. difference.		chardonnay port

china	Feeling is not filtered? Excessive wall hanging? ? Decanter inner surface. The taste is still available, Merle was already softer. Mello drank too much and later turned to Pinot Noir.		chardonnay port
china	In the same period, two bottles were imported, one from a friend and the other bottle. It was a problem. Not recommended for purchase		chardonnay port
china	Just tried it tomorrow night and it was a good drink. After 50 percent off activities, it should be the lowest price of the entire network, and this value is of great value for this quality. Last night, we ordered additional bottles! After the addition was received, there were two bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon, and I looked back to the code where there was the same code? Is the meaning of the same lot?		chardonnay port
china	The information was written in 2010, but it was received in 2015. It was just canned at the end of 2016... It tastes okay, but it always feels uncomfortable		chardonnay port
china	After the bottle opened, the scent had a clear fruity sensation, and it was refreshed for more than half an hour. The oak barrel tasted very well and there was a distinct woody smell. The entrance acidity was low, the tannins were medium, and there was almost no bitterness. It was quite comfortable to drink.		chardonnay port
china	The taste of the wine is not inferior to that of a lot of French wine, and the bottle is very good. But excellent courier really is not to force, not a quasi-pointer, do not give a text message in advance to make him communicate with him, and, many times, can not swipe, really make people speechless!		chardonnay port
china	The picture information (bottle label) is displayed for the 2006 vintage. The actual year 2013 was bought because the product information does not indicate that the sold product may be inconsistent with the picture. Therefore, I understand that the grape picking year is 2006. . We hope Amazon will improve it, otherwise it will mislead consumers.		chardonnay port
china	Do not know how to do this, send the wrong address, send it directly in the cupboard, received a text message does not know what is wrong, so no refusal. Three points to yourself, confusing		chardonnay port
china	They always drink their Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Every time they drink, they can always feel the passion and enchantingness of South America from her pleasant aroma and plump wine. The friend also recommends their family Syrah. One of the most prized women, they decided to try it.		chardonnay port
china	In September last year, I ordered two bottles of Kameni. I had a drink yesterday and I was bitter. I watched the picking of the label in 2015. I canned it in March 2017. At home, I was kept away from the light. I haven’t bought a few drinks in Amazon. Encountered like this, hey, no longer dare to		chardonnay port
china	On the weekend, I had friends cooking at home, trying to make a braised pork, two whole dishes, and opening a bottle of Marquis Merlot. It feels good to match. A bottle of meal did not finish, eat some cheese in the evening, is also a good match		chardonnay port
china	The Shiraz of Chile drank for the first time, and the aroma was very good after the bottle was opened, but the entrance was much flatter. In the middle and high wines, the presence of oak barrels is very strong, acidity is high, tannins are high, but the black fruity flavor typical of Syrah is rather weak, leaving only the taste of oak barrels. Not looking so satisfactory, I feel very general, it may be the relationship between the years, it may also be a problem of preservation, and later try to see if I can reverse my impression.		chardonnay port
china	The taste is very sour, not worth the price, not even 75 yuan wine tastes good		chardonnay port
china	Originally intended to drink with pleasure, but it felt wrong to open a bottle, wine cork is very rough, the wine is poured out of color is not normal, at first glance it seems that the color is not very uniform, and it feels very thin, like alcohol plus Pigment tone, drink it really is to verify my thoughts, some Merlot that there is no sense of supple, that is, the feeling of alcohol, as well as unnatural bitterness, the first time in the Amazon to buy alcohol, express broken I will endure three times, but what does it mean to sell me fake wine! Why can't you give zero stars!		chardonnay port
china	Two bottles were bought one after another. The first bottle was tried on its own and it felt smooth, fresh and aroma. Pure drink without side dishes. Feel more suitable for novice wine lovers, and immediately buy a bottle of gifts. The price is very good.		chardonnay port
china	A comparison with the East to buy, this wall hanging taste slightly better		chardonnay port
china	1, sober for half an hour, the entrance is comfortable 2, buy 6 bottles without a box; single bottle of air bubble bag protection, no box no bag, suitable for drinking at home.		chardonnay port
china	Balanced, clear wine red, light fruit aroma, like. The bottle jacket has a ring of inflatable cushions. The protective measures are good.		chardonnay port
china	When I bought the 2010 vintage, I could see it. The result was the 2011 vintage. Although the quality of the two years is not very different, the 2010 vintage is ranked 62nd in WS Magazine's 2013 Top 100 Wines, which is not as good at all.		chardonnay port
china	Seeing that the comment was 2013, the result was received in 2014. It is recommended that the merchant mark the year.		chardonnay port
china	As the New World's Chilean red wine, this price (reduced) does not have to be said that the price of this wine, the iconic Cabernet Sauvignon taste, better than Montesio France Cabernet Sauvignon, but Syrah is not comparable		chardonnay port
china	It is not true that the red devil is not a grade. The red devil keeps a toast. This is very resistant to drink, a slightly higher degree, the drinker is not afraid to greet the cup.		chardonnay port
china	The wine is light, the entrance is not sour, it can be accompanied by drinking and drinking.		chardonnay port
china	The year does not match the picture. 2010 is better than 2015. The price is to buy 4 pairs to reduce 100		chardonnay port
china	The dry wine in the middle of the dew is considered to be the entry wine for the elementary wine tasting. The fruity taste overshadows the aroma of the wine and requires a longer period of time to observe the changes in the wine body.		chardonnay port
china	And I bought 159 special price 59 Lafite 2016, the same taste. . . Alcohol taste (sulphur dioxide) is too heavy. No taste		chardonnay port
china	The logistics is too slow. The 21st order will arrive on December 1st. Logistics will be better soon. The wine looks authentic and drinks over time		chardonnay port
china	When I bought it and gave it away, I looked at the date it was filled in March of this year. The time was too close. I felt a sense of suspicion.		chardonnay port
china	Compared with Yellow-tailed Kangaroo, the taste is too much, the price can buy two bottles		chardonnay port
china	3 bottles of Kabini, 3 bottles of Merlot, gifts are good		chardonnay port
china	How to buy two bottles of wine is not the same, the same wine two bottles of two kinds, one of which has never seen before		chardonnay port
china	There is not much to drink red wine, not much, the color of the wine is OK, but there is no hanging cup, wine flavor is also considered, like the taste, can only say not your favorite taste and taste it		chardonnay port
china	Good taste, a little fruity complex aroma, good packaging, each bottle is packed individually with inflatable bag		chardonnay port
china	Look at the photo is the bottom of the skin, not actually. Slightly sorry, but fortunately things can still be priced		chardonnay port
china	The taste is very rich, pure taste, the entrance is very good, not too astringent. After drinking, the time for sobering up is faster.		chardonnay port
china	This wine is fake. The red does not spread on the tissue, and the tongue is dark. The premise is to drink a glass and hope that the consumers will not be fooled.		chardonnay port
china	The fruit is rich, the wine is more balanced, and the individual feels tannins can focus again. For 14 years, I regret buying less.		chardonnay port
china	The packaging is very good, that is, the wine is relatively new, and then put it for some time to drink it.		chardonnay port
china	Did not drink, that is, the packaging is too simple, and the invoice is all meters		chardonnay port
china	Yes, the highest cost-effective drink, the best is 50% off the most cost-effective wine, good		chardonnay port
china	Shiraz sobers up for 15 minutes. Black fruit Aroma highlights Raspberry Mulberry Cherry Chocolate Warm spice Shaker is even more aroma Intense temperature control at 17 octave single tannins Medium sour More balanced Back to used Table with a single braised duck is very comfortable to buy two get one free good price is worth a product of intermediate wine	raspberry cherry spiceberry chocolate light sour	chardonnay port
china	Prime day to buy, very value, very heavy wine, not bad		chardonnay port
china	The red devil who used to drink dry dew, this should be better		chardonnay port
china	The first review of Amazon's orders was so exciting. The wine is just like that, but it hasn't been drunk yet. It's made in 2012. See WS for a detailed introduction. Amazon is not professional when it comes to selling alcohol. When you bought it, you didn't know what year it was. Is it also a good thing to sell wine in the US? The main thing here is to take care of Amazon's services. It's really not good. The speed of express delivery is fine, but it is not even downstairs. Do not send, find a place to inform you to get away, never seen this service. It is useless to choose the delivery time, what day to send, and non-working day delivery are all white selections, always sent at the time you least expect.		chardonnay port
china	The taste is quite average, and the discounted price is also high.		chardonnay port
china	Poor evaluation of the logistics, 11 bottles of wine on the courier room and called me to say something to let me go to the courier room to move, I said that such large parts are reasonable to be delivered to the door, small pieces of words, then it does not matter I am generally also their own Go get it, and then the other party told me that you do not want to refuse to sign, and the whole speechless, and finally I'll say forget it, and eventually move it yourself. If you drink wine, you should wake up for at least half an hour before you can drink it.		chardonnay port
china	The goods are very good and the prices are very good. After drinking, rate the wine again.		chardonnay port
china	Haven't tried yet, but the dried red wine is still good		chardonnay port
china	Very easy entrance. . One folds down to 134.5. More expensive than before. 5.5. . . Let's go ahead. This wine is still good,		chardonnay port
china	White wine is really not used to drink, no more than 100 values. sour.		chardonnay port
china	Did not drink, look forward to very good, we all recommend		chardonnay port
china	The fruit is very strong, but the taste of this wine is sour.		chardonnay port
china	Yes, it tastes good. It is slightly astringent and slightly tannic. Maybe it is better to put some time into it. After all, it is a new bottle of wine in 2014		chardonnay port
china	The taste is normal, the tannins are high, and the new wine is not in agreement with the description. It is the 2016 wine, lacking layers, and a suggested retail price of 40 yuan. It is the most basic dry red.		chardonnay port
china	The Marquis, the middle-end wine of the Chilean Dry Dew, was still very good. The price was appropriate during the event. Amazon's after-sales service was also good.		chardonnay port
china	The red devil who has been drinking dew, and seeing the Marquis has a discount, buy it, very cost-effective.		chardonnay port
china	Can not buy Jiamena, can not buy Cabernet Sauvignon, only to buy two bottles of Pinot Noir, even made 2015 years, and halo, they can not return.		chardonnay port
china	I liked the aroma of this wine and I was most satisfied with the wine I had bought.		chardonnay port
china	This is a good drink and the taste is also very good.		chardonnay port
china	The taste of alcohol is very strong. It tastes like blending.		chardonnay port
china	The propaganda is 10 years of picking, but it is 14 years. This result is too disappointing. . . Amazon is not professional, I hope more people know, careful purchase! ! !		chardonnay port
china	Received red wine, great packaging, to prevent damage, activities received coupons to buy, affordable.		chardonnay port
china	After opening, the smell of alcohol came swiftly, and then poured a cup. The glass was like a thornbush. It was not right. The bright red of the syrup was obviously different from the normal wine. Then the glass of the glass was dyed red and I had countless red wines. Immediately aware of what it was, took a sip, which was alcohol, and then stung it. Drop a drop on a napkin with a large circle of white circles on the red edge in the middle. . . . . . Immediately understood that the dye blending. Since I think I understand wine very well, I still find it relatively clear that I have purchased the channels. In the end, I was put in by Amazon. The first bottle of fake wine I bought in life, or the New World wine, was too good. Recognize.		chardonnay port
china	Packing is OK, why is picking for 15 years and canning for 16 years?		chardonnay port
china	The propaganda website writes about the wine of 2010. The year of wine delivery in 2012 is a big impact on the price. It is not too bad to say that you sell fake goods.		chardonnay port
china	Afterwards, unable to comment on details, but this wine left a good impression. 50% off purchase, quite satisfactory.		chardonnay port
china	Because it was too expensive, the red devil, the sunburst, and the distant mountain that used to drink dried dew, had caught the Marquess of the bottle to celebrate this time. I haven't opened the bottle yet. I can't evaluate the taste, but I haven't eaten the red devil.		chardonnay port
china	We saw 14.4 degree of alcohol of 2014 that we bought in 2010 and became 14!		chardonnay port
china	I never rated it before, I don't know how many points have been wasted. Now I know that points can be exchanged for money. I have to evaluate it well. Later, I copied the passage away. I can earn points, save trouble, and where to go. , directly issued on it, recommend it to everyone! !		cabernet sauvignon merlot sauvignon port cabernet
china	Wine arrived, logistics is awesome. I haven't drunk yet. I'll rate the wine later. However, isn't it good to send a bottle opener?		cabernet sauvignon merlot sauvignon port cabernet
china	Well, Chile's famous wineries, Chile's wine cost-effective		cabernet sauvignon merlot sauvignon port cabernet
china	With the right price for the event, Maximino is a good wine, delivery speed is very fast, and the quality of the wine is also good.		cabernet sauvignon merlot sauvignon port cabernet

china	The wine label is very much like; the real thing is very upscale;		port
china	This wine has almost no scent and taste. Raw oak tastes particularly heavy! This is Amazon's most unsuccessful purchase of red wine! Strongly recommend not to buy! !		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	During the promotion, several cases of Syrah and Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon blended in 2012 were purchased. The dates of production were marked on November 26 and 28, 2013 respectively. Because Australia generally picks grapes in March and April, it is estimated that there will be a certain amount of bucket time before bottling. I feel that the price of credit is very high.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Difficult to drink, bought a 2012 mussels, feels good, no goods to buy this, hard to drink, strongly requested to return		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Town shop treasure and a price, fooled! Amazon is playing in this way and sooner or later it is forced to die by Jingdong. . . The wine is a bit of dregs and feels like it was diluted with water. Stay awake a little longer, taste improved.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	I have always not loved white wine. I always feel that I am sour and tasteless. I am not as warm and fragrant as red grapes. This wine made me change. First off topic, to praise Amazon's packaging, the bottle is considered a fragile product, and Amazon's packaging is always meticulous and safe, the wine bottle is safely lying in the middle, each bottle is equipped with an independent thick bubble pad to protect very Appropriateness can be safe even if it falls directly. The wine itself is very refreshing. The entrance looks like a fruit juice blended with cool spring water. It is slightly sour, more pure and refreshing. This person who did not like white wine could not help but complete a complete bottle.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	There weren’t many red wines that had been in contact with Australia before. Although this is an entry-level, it has a good taste and is particularly appetizing.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The wine was received. No drink was left without comment. But this package is too broken. Without any anti-collision materials, the boxes are rags and odors are unpleasant. This is Amazon's service? A treasure to buy a bottle of vinegar in three layers outside the three-tier package before delivery. Isn't this the way to die? Do not say, we look at the map, waiting for explanation!	vinegarodor	cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Hey! Not good. The first time I bought 128 three bottles! It was a cork at that time! There is no cork now! Feeling a lot cheaper! And I bought 1000 pieces! sad!

china	This wine is cost-effective, the entrance is not sour, after all Shiraz, do not like the friends of Cabernet Sauvignon can start this wine, the degree is not high, very good drink at the party. Amazon delivery is also fast, the bottle is in good condition and clean.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Try a new brand, Australia is not too bad wine, can be more palatable		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Two bottles have been released for two years. I don't know what it tastes like. The general taste that was bought before was like that		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	What kind of dissatisfaction is there for this wine? !		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Drink wine is OK, not astringent, that is, when the receipt of the goods, the wine lid is still crushed, a bit leaked, but not a lot, or received		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	This price is fine, and the one point that is deducted is the cap. Why is it not a cork?		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Better than some AOC bought last time. Australia is also a good wine		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	It's hard to drink, it's not a taste, it's not bought anymore.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The gap with expectation is a bit big. Just after the entrance is fine, drinking alcohol is too heavy and it is not good to drink.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Purchased on November 11, the price is favorable and tastes good. Unfortunately, the metal cap used is not a cork stopper.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

Will not buy again.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The taste of the wine is OK, and it is said that it is true color in Australia, but the barcode scanning result does not match the label on the bottle. I wonder why? It's about the same as I bought at Australian supermarket $9.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Yes, the taste is OK! ! It is recommended to wake up and the friend who is anxious to drink is not suitable! Is there anything really important about cork? I think this screwing is more clean and sanitary, so the price of a cork does not have any obvious value! Instead, I feel unhygienic!		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Just received, did not drink, the packaging is very simple and easy to break, the bottle cap has been sharpened, can not give away. The taste and so on I drank it again to do the evaluation, looks like imported from the bottle so temporarily to the four stars		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	The price is very affordable, not a professional tasting.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	When he opened the wine, he found that there was no cork. He suddenly felt that the wine was a defective or fake wine. The label of the bottle was checked again and it was sold by Amazon. It does not understand wine itself, but it doesn't feel good to drink (very subjective, forgive me). , Directly to the Amazon overseas mining, only suddenly bought a box, regret it ah. It seems that we must learn a lesson next time. 1. Do not blindly believe in Amazon, 2. Try to buy a bottle first		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Red wine is no problem, is a good wine, 16kg of wine, only 0.2gj of packaging, after crossing the ocean, finally reached the hands of buyers, wine bottles have fallen in the delivery car, and can only bring its own bag 12 red wine home! what! God blessed not burst bottle, miracle! miracle! Can the packaging improve? Because it will be purchased in the future, but do not want to bring their own bag!		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	This wine feels a problem. The taste is very bad. It has a strong smell of alcohol. When you drink it, you drink it and drink it 100ML the next day. It also causes a headache the next day. The key is still not returned, ready to play 315 complaints.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Wine is ok, but I have not bought it again recently. What's wrong? I refuse to accept!		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	The picking year was written without a specific date. The production date was December 15, 2015. 100% is picked in November 15th, immediately brewed, and it will be filled and pitted after one month. 12 bottles of wine up to more than 450, please give up. The lowest wine is brewed for a year and then filled, this is too fast. It's better to brewed, packing slag to the explosion, a good thin cardboard box. Strange ems This, garbage transport did not detonate, add pictures tomorrow, everyone wants to drink wine, choose the American brand cheap, taste good, that good wine Italy and France, other countries, the brand is too young	date datethin	cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The taste is relatively light, the price is generally good		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The wine bottle is still very good. The first time I bought the blend, the one I wanted to express was the shipping package. I received the flat box (40x40x8 cm) for the first time. As a result, I looked good outside. In the absence of any prediction, the bottle mouth is severely worn and very skillful, it will not leak out, the air column is also broken, very unhappy, customer service has repeatedly stressed that can not be returned, do not want to embarrassed the express company, this packaging is okay, but also when the receipt goods? ? ? I really suffer from loss.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The wine is very general, not cork. The wine tastes light, and with a decanter, the odor of sulfur is still great. The difference between the French liqueur and the Golden Lion, which was bought at the same price, was two or three levels. Not recommended for purchase		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Amazon's price is cheaper than Jingdong, so buy a bottle to try, but it's a bit stinky to drink it. Others are not bad, delivery speed, the integrity of the package, etc., wine is a new wine last year, there is no cork, the above information is provided for your reference		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	In terms of acidity, I think I can accept it. Satisfaction is not an astringent, but it will continue to try other brands of red wine. It should not be a time when customers return to buy the bottle of wine. On the shopping page, they see Amazon's direct supply. After placing orders with one click, I saw that it was necessary to pay postage fees. I also thought that the packaging was heavy for the sake of wine and so on. I had to collect the courier fee. After the payment was completed, I saw that it was supplied by other suppliers, so I needed to add postage. . The next time you buy it, you need to look at it more clearly. The old people think that it is not Amazon's own supply that is very unprotected. Just click the link and change the home supplier to buy this wine.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Not the oak sieve, the smell is very red, the degree is far more than described? Just a little headache on the drink, a point price of goods. Domestic logistics is too slow, it is recommended that Amazon strengthen domestic warehousing and logistics.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	There is no clear indication that the red wine extraction and filling indicated on the packaging of the year 2012 have been clearly stated. Many of the imported red wines in the shopping mall are not clearly stated. There was a delicate fragrance of fruit during the opening of the bottle, and the tasting taste was the sour and sour taste. The sourness was like the unripe grapes. Changsha was just under heavy rain at the time of delivery. The system automatically delayed the delivery date by one day (I personally think that consumers should be informed in advance). This is not the type of red wine I like.	datethin heavy ripe delicate sour	cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

Oh, the taste is not very good, and other descriptions do not feel it.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	"Originally, it was purchased in accordance with the ""2 months subscription order"" method. As a result, the first bottle drank and it was too hard to eat. Other red wines are only slightly acidic. This red wine is not only sour, but also has a high degree of alcoholicity. It is hard to squat, and it has to cancel the ""order province""."		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	The packaging is very delicate and solid. You don't have to worry about the transport loss. But the cork stopper used for wine bottles is not a cork.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	After buying it twice, this time it doesn't seem like it. Don't understand why it's a screw-open metal cap instead of a cork stopper.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	I haven’t drunk yet. I used to drink French wine for the first time. I’ve bought the red devil for the first time, but my reputation is OK, I’ve got a good appearance, and I’m giving OK. I hope that the wine itself will not disappoint me. Packaging is good. To add one, this wine sold more than 130 in the supermarket, Amazon is really very affordable!		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	I don't know why. I feel pain when I drink a drink, but I believe in Amazon. I think it won't be fake. Do not understand		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	The first time I drink the red devil, I don't know if it's a problem with the wine or the wine I've bought. The entrance is obviously sour and there is a strange smell. It's a bit like the taste of some medicine I've eaten before. It's still sobering. I was accompanied by braised meat and steamed fish. I was sad to get into my stomach and I really wanted to go to the bathroom. After dizzy, I really couldn't dare to drink anymore. Whether it was a wine problem or a problem wine, in short I gave up the red devil.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	And a taste of homemade 20-bottle wine does not lie to you		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

It arrived at the scheduled time and looked good. Liked it, the taste is not yet open, but the friend recommended the red devil. I hope that I can send one wine to my friends every year.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet
china	Two bottles were bought and two bottles were sent in a few days. I retired. Later I bought two bottles of French wine.

china	The advertisement is written on the basis of 12 years of picking, and it is really 14 years old to get the goods. This is a fraudulent consumer. No matter how good or bad the wine is, it should not be like this.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon port cabernet

china	Previously bought several times at JD, the surface of the bottle was very smooth with a 3x magnifier and the die interface was smaller. This time, the wine bottle purchased here is rough, the bottle body is pitted, the mold interface is large and not smooth, and it can be judged by the naked eye that the bottle is authentic Chinese goods. The reason is that the European industry has a solid foundation and the processed bottle molds are excellent in workmanship. The blown-out bottle technology is generally much better than authentic Chinese goods, and the finish is generally several degrees higher. Therefore, my purchase of the nominal (Australia) wine will not be purchased once for the second time. I also hope that netizens will polish their eyes and purchase carefully.		moscato

china	Last night at 9 o'clock in the Amazon online wine, returning from playing this morning has quietly waited for the door. It's much more efficient than going to a supermarket next door. This logistics speed is amazing! [Strong] Open a beautiful peach carton. My wine is wrapped in Amazon's patented pillars of red wine, like a baby who has been carefully cared for, and then covered with a soft cushion bag, so that the safe and secure packaging design meets people. Love. [Color] [color] compared to those ash, dirty, poor quality plastic film, dropped all over the ground also with electrostatic sweeping clean foam particles, Amazon's receiving experience I do not know how many times it! [Strong] I am the most annoying to tear down those terrible packaging [weak]. The label behind the wine also has a description of Amazon’s direct adoption at the Australian winery. The fidelity of the product is very important. Drink a fake drink and die! The price is not expensive, after the spike of more than 100 discount prices more than 100 [laughing] pleasure of e-commerce shopping is back!

china	The quality is general, the taste is not full, but the cherry flavor is very strong and the wine is small.	cherryflavor strong	port
china	It's hard to drink. The first ingredient in the ingredient list is sorbic acid. You say that the taste of all the sour water is not as good as the carbonated soda.		port
china	I used to buy wine before. . This ice flirting reputation is still good. . However, it hasn't been bought since the rise. . This time in Amazon saw the previous price. . Resolutely shot. . . It is still not drinking. . Do not know true and false. . . . The price is right. . . .		port
china	Fake, drink authentic, this taste is completely different, it is difficult to drink		port
china	More precipitation, ah, taste sour, smell a bit strange, all the way to go before the bottle opened, and then forgot, and the result sprayed. . . Everyone carefully before opening the bottle. . .		port
china	So far, the favorite sparkling wine is very suitable for partying and drinking, the feeling of wine is not heavy, but it is also the top of the oh ~~		port
china	Bought, drank, and did not understand, the whole was good.		port
china	The taste is great for family members. Drink too much, there is stamina.		port
china	The first time I drink sparkling wine, the taste is sweet, I feel like a soda, after which there will be a faint taste of wine, the stamina is relatively heavy		port
china	The whole thing is the lowest, and Amazon owns it with confidence. The packaging is very safe, but the bottle has scratches, and there is no packaging bag to send people.		port
china	It smells aromatic, especially the smell of strawberries is obvious. The entrance was sour, and the awakening of astringency was greatly improved in twenty minutes, but sourness was still sour after one night. After the lower abdomen, there was a slight bitter taste in the mouth, and the longer the release, the more obvious.		port
china	Buy when the spike, taste good, easy to talk about.		port
china	Drink it two days later, this is a glass bottle, but the packaging really does a good job, shock-absorbing plastic film, air plastic bag, make people feel relieved.		port
china	Packing is very good Color looks good for female friends gathering		port

china	The taste is as good as ever. Icy and loyal consumers.		port
china	It is recommended to drink once after opening and the taste will be changed after storage.		port
china	When I drink with my family during the holiday season, I always say that the old ones drink well, like more than 100 yuan of wine.		port
china	It's almost like a soda, not to mention any taste and taste, but the packaging is good		port
china	In sparkling wine, I feel very strong. The packaging is very good and it is a good wine with good price/performance ratio. I am a spike.		port
china	There is no drink at the moment. Look at the packaging. Wait until after drinking to evaluate.		port
china	Sparkling wine is completely different from dry red, but individuals still don't like something a bit harsh. However, the wine itself is still good and the packaging is solid.		port
china	I do not know if it is true or false ~ and the bottle has scratches! Labeling is vague! Product packaging simple!		port
china	The price of the event is really good, and the taste of ice can still be obtained		port
china	The packaging is strong and crashworthy to one star, and the courier service is good to one star (the speed is still lost to JD), ¥69 price concessions to one star! The wine is produced in January 2013. The color is no longer young. Although there is no labeling for Beijing sugar, it is indeed true wine from the color point of view! After opening the wine has deteriorated! The cork is not moist enough and it should be stored in a standing position. Over time, oxidation has affected the aroma of the wine! In fact, Jeskas and Jung Fu are my favorite two South Australian brands! (Ben Fugui not cost-effective) usually this wine to hundred dollars, this special offer I actually hesitated when ordering, or buy it! The next time it won't be cheap, the wine is best to be sold within a year after the new wine is awake. I don't know much about wine. It's purely personal and for reference only!		
china	Previously prepared to buy in the other site but felt that the store was extremely flicker discount activities in the waiting for business information in the 3 days I canceled so choose this feeling should be okay delivery soon to the family to buy is not my receipt It's not me, so it's only so rated		
china	It is assured that Amazon's packaging, wrapped in vacuum packaging, does not have to worry about the problem of transportation damage. If you have a bag, it's better		
china	Very well-known red wine, the price is relatively high.		
china	When I bought it, I didn't report that much expectation, so after I received it, I tried it better than the Great Wall.		
china	The online description was in 2008 and the delivery came in 2009. I've been buying things on Amazon before and I'm now skeptical about Amazon’s credibility!		
china	The first time I drank Australian wine, I couldn’t talk about where it was good or not.		
china	Did not expect shipping speed is very fast! Ok! ! ! The quality of this wine is very worthy of this price. Will continue to buy drops.		
china	Amazon's delivery speed and packaging are absolutely reassuring. The wine did not drink, I do not know how.		
china	Drinking Australian wine for the first time, it feels good		
china	100 or so wines are the best, but remember to put them in the shade		
china	As a person who drank more than three years of red wine, Jacques Amazon's direct value (because of discount). New World Wine, Australia is a big one, and Wolf Blass, Jacob's Creek, personal feeling, is its representative. Jakars is a member of Pernod Ricard, and Pernod’s name is more famous. Jeskas is trustworthy.		
china	I have always been pleased with Australian wines, but this is one of the best priced red wines in China. Try it and you will not regret it :)		
china	It feels good to drink and I haven't had a good drink, but this is one of the favorite ones.		
china	A worthy wine. Personally feel that this wine is just like the interpretation of the wine label to give people a sincere and concise sense. There will be no exaggerated seduce and there will not be too many surprises. Accurate but not mediocre. When you open the bottle, you may feel a bit tight and when you wake up in the cup, you can smell the rich black fruit with a bitter black pepper and smoky flavor. After drinking for a while, I felt slightly pungent, but I didn't know if it was a wooden bucket.		
china	Since the discovery of the affordable and soft Kangaroo Mountain Shiraz, this has passed.		
china	I did not drink this wine before, I feel bad taste, not easy to enter the throat. I still have a headache the next day after drinking.		
china	Did not drink this wine before, I feel bad taste, not easy to enter the throat. I think it may be fake wine		
china	When I was ready to drink, tear the tin foil and found the bottle's mouth broken. I also cut my hand.		
china	The taste is very poor, worse than the products in the mainland, and Amazon lost 10 years in a special case, and made a bad brand.		
china	The taste of wine is not as good as that of Wal-Mart.		
china	Good taste! The next time it is Changyu! Drinking is not the same.		
china	In fact, foreign wine producers, especially international giants such as Jeskas, decided to use cork or screw caps according to the habits of local consumers in exporting countries. In our country, this wine uses cork, because the domestic people still prefer a little more cork. You can compare it with other e-commerce sites. If you buy a screw-capped Jakas, it must not be genuine.		
china	It took me some time to buy, and my whim opened in the evening and I woke up for a few minutes to drink. The color of the wine is dim, and the wall is almost empty. The fruit is rich and mellow. When you just drink it, the taste is a bit stiff. It will slowly open. This is a good wine. Wine research is less, just a feeling. Thank you!		
china	It is much richer than expected, and taste is nothing special.		
china	The body is not thin. The taste is not coarse. The acidity is low. The tannin is moderate. It is suitable for the contact with the greasy table. It is also worthwhile to do evening tasting. It is more appropriate to compare with the present fold. To send the Helan Mountain is too disappointing.		
china	Read reviews, combined with the last thing to buy milk, very worried, canceled the order		
china	When buying during the promotion, I feel that the price is right, the taste is normal, the bottle mouth is plastic, the appearance of a very low-grade,		
china	As a loyal customer to Amazon, I have always been a good believer of products labeled “Amazon Direct” and “Authentic Guaranteed”. This wine made me very disappointed! I lived in Australia for 12 years and I know more about the local wine. There are several reasons why this wine I believe to be fake: 1. Australia's mid-to-low wine does not need to be corked many years ago. This type of wine is generally not a collection. It is bought and sold. Therefore, in order to save costs, the merchant uses a metal lid. The bottle of wine that I received was a cork. 2. The authentic wine is dark red in color, not a bright red. Shake the glass, there should be a small amount of wine left on the cup wall. However, this wine is not like water. The wine smells like no fragrance. 3. The most important thing is that it tastes wrong. Authentic wine should be thick, with rich flavors and layers. This wine tastes astringent, light and flat, and it feels like blending juice. Anyway, the taste is certainly not authentic. I hope everyone will not buy this wine, be careful!		
china	Jekars melot should be selected by the winemaker, this level of taste is generally		
china	I saw a report introducing Jacob's Creek, a famous Australian wine. I know that it is a well-known Australian brand.		
china	Drink this several times, I feel pretty good, tannins are less sour, and individuals like it better.		
china	Do not evaluate the pros and cons. Just see the 2nd bottle at half price. And re-confirmed before ordering, the list of instructions for my order is 2008. Delivery to me is 2011 vintage. Although the price of the two vintages is the same, we cannot treat it like this! ! !		
china	In Amazon, I don't know how long it took to buy too much. Why is this the worst? Because I had a bad loss! Even though the package looks normal, the bottle also has a plastic air septum wrapped around it, but after opening it looks a little wine stain on the bottom of the bottle, leaving a bit on the finger, because it did not expect other problems, thought it was glued on the outside of the bottle of. Then because of the night's intentions to drink, open it with a bottle opener on the wonderful, and the wine began to drop to the ground, only to see it, the bottle body has been a lot of cracks, but actually did not open the bottle is not found! I go, only took out two cups and filled them directly. The key is, how can I get it for you? And can not sell ah! ! Hey~~

This, I do not know what the blending, no wine taste, drink a lot of no sense of wine slightly savory, and drink, stomach screaming, fart, drink this winter I know through the cold. I have always wanted to adapt to the so-called new tastes and have been unacceptable. As a result, I do not like Amazon! The first Amazon shopping experience is so bad, why?

china	This French Moet and Chandon pink champagne tastes good. But what I drank was the original wine brought back from France. Domestic imports have not been drunk and should be very good.

This wine is not suitable for early adopters, but it's better not to be uncomfortable. After about half an hour, I feel no more. The packaging is very good and delivery is fast. Try another blistering next year. Because the distribution is faster and more reliable, I can now even buy the wine in Amazon. I'm sorry to buy a hahaha.		port

One box is just the original packaging carton of wine, without any protection (the plastic film is not available). When it is received, the carton has been damaged. See the photo for details. How can you give it away? The two stars are for this packaging and do not represent the quality of the wine. The other box was shipped with Amazon.com and shipped with other products. The protection was very good, but on the original carton, a lot of words were written using ballpoint pens, including ""6X7t Liu Chunyu Liu Chunyu."" It was silent!"		port

A little bit of sweetness, but the bubble is not much, and it is not much to shake it. I thought it was the sort of open bubble that rushed to the sky when celebrating abroad. The degree of alcohol is not high, only 6 degrees, it is indeed suitable for cooking wine, and I do not often drink people.		moscato port

china	Sparkling wine is generally sweet, this dry type of sparkling wine will not be sweet, perfect to avoid the problem of not drinking sweet wine. The amount of aeration is not as great as that of ordinary sparkling wine. The taste is good and the taste is not heavy, but the entrance is mellow. When the friends gather together, they all share the praise and feel that the price is high. Has been repurchased.		baga port
china	Is a good table wine, but I prefer Moscato sparkling wine.		baga port
china	The taste is a bit like wine + Sprite. Did not feel particularly good to drink, iced strong after drinking.		baga port

china	Unique bottle design, very good grade, rich fruit scent good smell better drink. Gifts are also a good choice.		moscato port
china	Buying imported wine at Amazon is really good because of the benefits. The sweet taste of this wine is mingled with fruit aromas and bubbles to stimulate the taste buds. However, the bubbles in this wine are not as rich as champagne, and you do not need to worry about spraying when you open the bottle. After the corks are pulled out, they cannot be returned, so once they are opened, they should be consumed as soon as possible so as to prevent the bubbles from escaping and affecting the taste.		port
china	Italian wine, family loves it. This wine is sweet, there are bubbles, it feels a bit like a carbonated drink, but the taste is very good, each time poured 30 ml, with a glass to drink it feels more cool. Get it again when you are ready to engage in activities		port
china	I have finished drinking already. I also wrote reviews and disappeared. Very strange. Something good, something like pineapple beer.	pineapplethin apple	port
china	The taste is good, just like the one I bought in Hong Kong. It should be noted that once the sparkling wine is opened, it is difficult to seal it, so it is best to drink it at one time.		port
china	At first, it was attracted by its bottle. The bottle that had been bought with a gold lid had been tried before. I thought it was okay. I saw the special offer and bought all three bottles at a time. I tried it with a red lid, and I liked it very much. The taste is sweet and sour. It's better imported because I can't drink it. So I think this is more suitable for people like me who can't drink and who are not interested in wine. Sometimes it's nice to have a holiday to celebrate with your family.		port
china	Wine is OK, but it's hard to get it back, because the head is spherical, I'm 180, 160 pounds, and my strength is still a bit of strength, but I’m still trying to make it out, or can I not get it back?		port

china	The gas is full, the scent is elegant, and there is a sense of dimension B syrup at the entrance, but it is not hard to eat. The bottle is printed, very European style, not willing to throw away.		port
china	The color of the wine and the color of the bottle are very aesthetically pleasing. Even if the wine is not drinking, it is already very pleasing to see the bottle. This is probably the embodiment of the Italian art. No matter if the book is for personal use or for giving it away, we have a face. How does the country's wine packaging have no packaging beauty?		port
china	Has been purchased many times, suitable for family gatherings		port
china	Slightly different than the imagination, the whole is acceptable, full of five stars		port
china	Qingsheng buy, taste very sweet, cost-effective, will buy back.		port

china	The wine is bestowed on beauty. Alcohol is 8%. I only smell one, drunk-usual beer.		port
china	Very palatable sparkling wine, especially in the summer, and even people who don’t like to drink say it’s good to drink.		port

china	Suitable for a drink, slightly sour taste, after the ice should be better		port
china	I haven't drunk yet. The wine bottle looks well. The express packaging material is safe. The express delivery efficiency is strengthened. It is already slow. The express delivery is late for a day than the scheduled time. It is not happy.		port
china	Lite, no box, but the package is very safe, the price is more appropriate, bought at discount,		port
china	Amazon is very good for its own products, whether it is package or service, especially for pit fathers. As long as you can buy in Amazon, you will never spend second-hand money.		port

china	The bottle looks good, the price is right, the taste is refreshing, it's good		port
china	The taste surpassed this price, trusting Amazon to adopt		port
china	Still good, AOC grade, packaging looks at the grade, the Spring Festival party is very suitable		port
china	In general, the mouth was nearly collapsed when the bottle was opened. Just unscrew the metal buckle and it collapses.		port
china	Foam is rich, the entrance is cool, it is to drink as soon as possible		port
china	Rotari Rotari Natural pink sparkling wine has been received, drank, and tastes good.		port
china	Not particularly fond of, originally thought it was fruity, in fact, is a dry taste, and more foaming, red nose		port
china	The taste is normal, do not want to buy back, try something else		port
china	First of all, I'm not a drinker. The following review is just a personal opinion of a sweet consumer. I don't like to lightly spray. First of all, there is a slight bitterness in the wine (I really don't like it), and, There is also a rich acidity in the wine, which is indeed very suitable for pre-dinner wine, and it is because of its sour taste that I also reluctantly accept the taste of bitter, but the drink alone is also somewhat acidic.		port
china	Slightly astringent. But as a sparkling wine for this price. very good.		port
china	The bubble is very rich, the sweetness is low, the entrance is a bit rushed. Relative to the black card gold taste is better, personal opinion		port
china	This wine tastes good, the best in the road goods. More foaming, softer texture. Supermarkets sell from time to time, but there are more black cards and gold medals are harder to buy. The price fluctuations on the Internet are too big, but in general they are slightly expensive.		port
china	There is a difference between the taste of Sam and the supermarket. Is the product the same?		port
china	Better than the same price red wine. Domestic wine transport storage is a serious problem. Often open to drink sour, it is not cheap. However, the quality of this wine is stable and the price is real. Will buy again.		port
china	The wine is good, but in order to clear the inventory, Amazon backstage privately raised the buyer review star, I have screenshots, do not respect the market freedom, not objectively undesirable		port
china	The bottle looks good, the price is right, the taste is refreshing, it's good		port
china	The taste surpassed this price, trusting Amazon to adopt		port
china	Still good, AOC grade, packaging looks at the grade, the Spring Festival party is very suitable		port
china	Give five stars, taste good, but slightly burned stomach, easier to go up, may be my drink is not good, but very good		port
china	The first drink is a little unsuitable, because the domestic champagne is just like the sweet drink, but this French champagne is not sweet near the wine. It is worth pondering good.		
china	Family gatherings are very good. 1.5 liters, attention is 1.5 liters!		
china	After receiving the goods, it was found that there was no packaging, which was inconsistent with the picture. I do not know whether it was genuine or not. I hope Amazon will not destroy the brand.		
china	The taste is very good, the price is more appropriate, recommended		
china	Always like this brand. Amazon's delivery is in place. Thank you.		
china	In fact, the taste is very general, like white wine with soda		
china	The bottle was damaged. The original purchase was to look at the bottle.		port prosecco
china	Very satisfied with this port, the packaging is intact!		port prosecco
china	It's too sweet! As sweet and sweet as a sweet white, it's sweet to have to write a review. No wine taste.		port
china	ASZÚESZENCIA, considered a strange rating, has been with 3 baskets for 14 years, and 4 baskets have been cancelled. This seems to have been seen at the end of the Tokaj auction catalog, at least not for the domestic Zhejiang company. Although the grape picking time was 2003, the nominal filling date actually was 2006? 2 years came out, how much is this winery short of money, and oak barrels were filled in two years? Therefore, the bottle shoulder does not have the Hungarian national emblem and number? Is it the case that the Amazon Chinese label is wrong or the winery is? The traditional tradition before 2013 is that ASZUE 3 baskets should be at least 5 years in oak barrels, 6 baskets and 8 years. ASZUEESZENCIA must add at least 6 baskets for 1 year. The bottle shoulders do not have a national flag and digital code, and they feel there is a cottage or domestic The informal feeling of filling the barrel after filling. Shorter oak barrels are not as good as Szamorodni. There is no significant reduction in the value of the sweetness index.	datesweet short	port
china	There is a leak at the bottle mouth, which wets the small logo on the bottleneck! This shows that the wine is definitely running out!		port
china	Like a liqueur, there is a bit of alcohol. You don't have to drink a day like the average wine, you can drink a little bit after the meal every day.		port
china	Really good entrance, pay close attention, will consider buying again		port
china	High-alcoholic, semi-sweet, full-bodied taste, fast delivery, and the price is very satisfactory.		port
china	After refrigerating, drinking and drinking taste better		port
china	I rarely drink this kind of wine at ordinary times, this feeling is very close to my taste. However, it was too late for me to evaluate and I forgot what the specific taste was. I only remember it was good to drink.		port
china	After a bottle of wine has been placed in the refrigerator for nearly a month, white sugar will appear. This is wine, not! This is fruit juice with white sugar, plus a bit of sweet acid! Also tuned!		port
china	Colleagues and friends all saw it! Not willing to open! Sweet collections are		port
china	The poor attitude of logistics services was directly given to the district supermarkets, which was far worse than Jingdong's services. The wine is sweet, especially after putting it in the fridge.		port
china	Although he does not drink sweet wine, but this time the girlfriend bought it feels very good, not expensive		port
china	The most famous wine in Hungary is tokaji, which is really good.		port
china	Activities start, the price of sweet wine to buy late is still good, sweet fruit, good taste, sweet and sour balance, satisfaction		port
china	Slightly sweet, lack of acidity, so it is not balanced. But this price, haha, it's OK		port
china	I don’t like to drink alcohol, but friends say it’s good		port
china	The taste of this thing is the wisdom of the beholder. If you drink, you can basically ignore other people's comments. This wine is this taste! Amazon's packaging is very scientific, the bottle is well wrapped with airbags, do not have to worry about damage.		port
china	In terms of sweetness, it's a bit like chocolate condensed milk (to say a lot like milk, but milk is not so sweet). I didn't expect the 17-degree wine to be so full of wine, and the sweet taste combined with the taste of the mouth was not harmonious. It is advisable to drink 1/3 of the water (not afraid of sweetness for 3 servings of wine, or vice versa), and to add some ice cubes, the taste will be much better.		port
china	The original sign on the bottle was made on glass. Now it is a sticker. It feels good and cheap. Ah ~~~~ What does it taste like? It won't drink every day.		port
china	Before I bought it, I believed in a lot of propaganda and what women liked. I said, my daughter-in-law didn't like to drink. I bought a few bottles and each time I came to a friend, I opened it and drank it for a few times.		port
china	It's really very, very, very sweet (important to say three times). Of course, everyone's taste is different. Someone who is especially sweet and sweet may think this level is OK. This is the phenomenon → After the wine is poured out, it is left standing. After a while, a thick layer of syrup will precipitate at the bottom of the cup. ← For your reference		port
china	It's true that the newly-packed shopping mall is not nearly as bubble-bubbled as it used to be, but it's so strong that when you open it, you know that the new packaging is perfect for people who aren't able to drink ice or milk. Mom's holiday favorite		port
china	It is suitable for women to drink. The entrance is rich and fragrant. The finish has a sense of wine, but it is not strong. However, this list of ingredients is too detailed, and all the ingredients are added. When you brush your cup, you take a shower of water and you get a lot of bubbles. For some reason?		port
china	Out of curiosity, he tried to eat a barbecue while drinking it. He didn't spit it out. Later, he didn't eat it. He just tasted it, and he gradually tasted like whisky mixed with thick chocolate milk.		port
china	Distribution is very fast and there is no difference with JD. Packaging is a big advantage and it is well protected. This is the reason why you have been buying alcohol in the Amazon. As for the fact that only the four stars should be the wine itself disappointed me, only 17 degrees but the wine tasted more than Mozart's 36 degrees, but it was a pity that the Mozart brand could not be found in the mainland electricity supplier.		port
china	One likes Beli Sweet! Watching movies and glasses of wine at home is great at night! The general public at the honey saw Amazon's push. Originally, it was to buy chocolates. By the way, it bought Bailey sweet and it was great!	honeychocolate sweet	port
china	Like to drink coffee and black tea, just add milk is nothing new, and just one day to see the ads, just want to try it. The taste of cream after drinking alone is very much liked, but the taste of wine is still very heavy, personally feel a bit awkward, 17% of alcohol is considered relatively high. Coffee with black tea is very good.	coffee cream coffeethin heavy	port
china	Forgot to consider the specifications of the silly election of this 750ml only 94 ah 唉唉唉 When I opened the package, I was stupid, I say how cheap, but in addition to personal reasons, other 5 points praised the product packaging careful logistics Super fast excellence ~ Support you! ! ~		port
china	Looked at the ingredients, are all flavors, eating alcohol and the like, even if the taste is OK, will not be bought later, I do not know whether it is Chinese-made or foreign is the same.		port
china	A wine that would make her like it, probably, although I have no say whatsoever. When I add ice cubes, it's great, and I feel like I can't grasp the amount of drinking. But this is not a big mistake for a fractious summer night.		port
china	Originally it was a very happy thing, the result had been broken when the wine was received, waiting for the seller to take the initiative to contact 3 days did not move, after the Amazon customer service, the seller still did not take the initiative to contact. Contact the seller and let him contact Amazon again. After that, there was no letter, and finally Amazon helped negotiate. In short is a very unhappy online shopping!		port
china	I only remembered that I had sold it in the evening after the order was placed, indicating that it was still a very popular item. I bought it in Hong Kong before, but it was almost HK$150. This price is a good deal here. I hope Amazon can do more of these special promotions. . . Like this! There is still logistics, and it will be the next day.		port
china	The second time to buy ~ pour a little bit a day, add some water, add some ice, treat yourself very good choice ~ gift is also very good, girls will love ~ but will feel dry mouth after drinking		port
china	For 4 stars, it's true that you don't know whether it's a high degree or what's the reason. The taste of alcohol is a bit like the taste of white wine. It's very good. It's good for ice. Drink it directly.		port
china	The alcohol content is too high for me. I plan to share it with everyone at Christmas time. The taste is more intense. Adding ice and milk is a good choice.		port
china	The taste is relatively smooth, not like the feeling of wine, that is, adding a little wine in the cream, very much the feeling of the former liquor chocolate, especially suitable for women to drink!	creamsmooth chocolate	port
china	First of all, it was delivered to the wrong address. It was only a few days before we arrived but missed the Mid-Autumn Festival. Then the bottle cap was not seen when it was inspected. It was actually a bad one. Although it did not leak out, but after opening it, it took off a hole. I did not know whether the goods were originally caused by the delivery process, and this was somewhat disappointing. It's pretty good, very strong ~		port
china	1:1 with fresh milk, add ice, very tasty! PARKnSHOP supermarket costs 138 yuan. Amazon is only 86 yuan, really cost-effective! Will continue to buy!		port
china	Personally feels okay. I didn't drink any wine of this taste before. It was purely a try. When the entrance is creamy, it's alcoholic, it's a little greasy, it should feel better with a little ice cubes		port
china	Affordable, drink did not feel false. Only the second day of news that the delivery of goods to manufacture a lot of fake wine, but also this, parents are more worried.		port
china	711 this is selling 120, here is so cheap to earn. From Jiangsu to Chengdu, undergraduates think that the road is so far away and dangerous. As a result, it is safe to receive the goods and the packaging is very strict. There is also an inflatable tube bag that is specially used to hold wine. . The taste is still very good. Like a ~ should also buy back.		port
china	I bought it long ago and it should be true. I remember that the packaging was particularly tight and I took the scissors for a long time.		port
china	Very good, with milk flavor and wine mellow, very good with		port
china	The creamy taste is very heavy, it is white and thick, it is fragrant. The taste of wine is still there, but as for whiskey or alcohol, it does not taste. Adding water and ice is very suitable for summer girls to drink.		port
china	It's too sweet. I didn't buy it so sweet. It's like ice cream. Add a strong taste of alcohol.	creamsweet strong	port
china	I bought a few bottles. The taste is very sweet and fragrant. I like it very much. However, this time it was discovered that the ingredients list became alcohol rather than pure whisky and was very disappointed.		port
china	Things really are authentic whiskey and milk taste more suitable for girls to drink in many cocktails, there will be with this Bailitian		port
china	Family recommended, first bought a bottle of Mid-Autumn test to drink, really good, personal feeling: This wine is better after adding cold ice.		port
china	I feel too sweet, a bit tired, I don't like this kind of wine		port
china	Well, this taste is acceptable to both men, women and children. Of course, this is only suitable for those who do not like to drink hard liquor, you know.		port
china	Good drink, with milk, explained below as mixed wine		port
china	Not yet open. Nothing to say about packaging, and as previously bought, with the past shopping experience in Amazon gave four stars.		port
china	The taste is good, I bought it. But this time I received the goods, there was wine leaking from the bottle mouth. The new metal bottle cap had a bad seal. Or.		port
china	It's okay to sit and drink. The packaging is very solid.		port
china	Really hard to drink, like the feeling of alcohol and milk		port
china	Super fast shipping less than 24 hours However, although the packaging is very careful, but the arrival of the paper box is a little scared to death I had the same price and the local Wal-Mart counters		port
china	Although a friend said that the elderly drink this wine, he is willing to go old. The mouthfeel is fascinating with the smoothness of the mouth. Although the milky taste is heavy, the alcohol concentration is still very high. It is best to add ice and drink. It is great! ~		port
china	Ordered last night, arrived the next day, tasted very good, plus ice cubes better.		port
china	This wine is 750ml less than I bought in Europe (250ml) I do not know whether to shrink the water for the Chinese products. The taste is OK, and it tastes like I bought in the Netherlands.		port
china	The packaging is great, Amazon's packaging is very responsible, delivery must be as fast as ever.		port
china	Gabriel is suitable for you to drink a little at night ~ add some ice and sweet feeling ~		port
china	The super cute little bottle is still the first time I saw it. I used to buy a big bottle, I always liked the taste, chocolate plus whiskey, delicious and unique!		port
china	Good drink, rich cream. Not intoxicating. Well packaged, exactly the same as in the supermarket but half cheaper. Buy it later.	creamrich aged	port
china	Amazon's service is really NICE, although the price is higher than Taobao's other sites. But I think it's very good value, very good, the product is also very good		port
china	For her husband's purchase, the amount of alcohol is not good, and it's good for milk. It's not bad, it feels like latte coffee.		port
china	It's good to drink, but with food...who can comment on it. Anyway, I feel incongruous with meat. Drink alone. Overall good		port
china	Wife and child drink, drink wine, basically no wine after the ice, but there is still stamina.		port
china	It has a good taste, value for money, and it is closer to “wine” than the kind of beverages in the dozens of colored bottles.		port
china	The items I received are different from those in the pictures. I am not the main drinker. I mainly appreciate it. The outline labels I received are not beautiful.		port
china	Not quite the same as before. It cannot be said to be false, but it may be another one.		port
china	The appearance of the bottle is slightly different, but the taste is fine and the aftertaste is a bit spicy		port
china	Wife used to send people, packaging is really mighty, it is estimated that the heart is not broken!		port
china	If I'm a drunkard, I just need this wine. The other tastes are great too!		port
china	There is nothing wrong with the packaging of the things. The taste is like the white liquor against some milk coffee. The taste of milk is the taste of milk, but there is a spicy feeling of white wine. It is not like very much.	coffeespicy thin icy	port
china	Although I don't like to eat sweet, it's really good to do ice cream or ice in the summer.	creamsweet	port
china	The entrance feeling is very texture, it is not suitable for women to drink directly, the feeling of spicy taste will make a lot of early loss of goodwill		port
china	I want to use it on Valentine's Day, so I will order it a few days in advance and I will send it to the day before work on Valentine's Day. . . Packaging is very good, professional, two bottles, protection is done well.		port
china	After adding milk, it is basically the same as drinking a drink.		port
china	The family said it was good and tasted different tastes		port
china	More like it, but don't like the careful selection of coffee		port
china	Very sweet and bitter, it really is not suitable for drinking		port
china	I like it very much and I like it! Regular purchase. . . . . .		port
china	The taste is very strong, the taste is thick, is the taste of coffee, the smell is very sweet wine. I do not like sweet, but husbands who like sweets like it.	coffeesweet strong	port
china	The sweetness of the cream and chocolate is also very good. It means that I don’t have enough wine for me to drink. But after all, it’s not a drink. In short, it’s strongly recommended, especially for girls.	creamchocolate sweet short strong	port
china	The taste is a little sweet, rich milky, but I don't quite understand why alcohol is		port
china	Very good pre-dinner wine, creamy taste really good		port

china	Did not drink sweet wine, when the 2.14 received, the time is just right! Drink with friends, all like it		port
china	After many comparisons, the price is the most affordable.		port
china	Unwittingly drunk, the wine is sweet, suitable for young people to drink, the real drunkard like spirits, please go around.		port
china	Quality is nothing to say, genuine, but logistics is not a little		port
china	Once opened, there is a very heavy taste of alcohol, and it will take a while to disperse. After drinking two or three times, the wine became odorless. The wine was not bought on Amazon. It was good to drink in the new egg.		port
china	When the New Year was bought, the family would like to drink.		port
china	"Less than 70 yuan 700ml price, confirmed to be genuine. The taste is not as good as the taste of other people saying that ""made in a domestic product doesn't taste as good as abroad,"" or as a pure chocolate whiskey! Thumbs up!"		port
china	No bottle has been opened, and the seal is damaged when it arrives		
china	It's not bad. Although it's a bit sweet, it tastes good. It's finished in two days.		
china	The entrance is smooth, moderate sweetness as ice wine, but slightly mellow.		
china	For individuals, the wine is too sweet, but adding ice cubes and mineral water, it feels really cool, sweet fruit like nuts and honey, activity half price to start, worth it.	honeytar cool sweet tart	
china	The mouthfeel is smooth, but the wine is not full and the body is thinner.		
china	It was not as good as expected, but it was also good. It was worth buying more than 300 items. It was a good deal, but it was white wine. I like red wine.

china	Distribution is very fast and there is no difference with JD. Packaging is a big advantage and it is well protected. This is the reason why you have been buying alcohol in the Amazon. As for the fact that only the four stars should be the wine itself disappointed me, only 17 degrees but the wine tasted more than Mozart's 36 degrees, but it was a pity that the Mozart brand could not be found in the mainland electricity supplier.		port
china	The original sign on the bottle was made on glass. Now it is a sticker. It feels good and cheap. Ah ~~~~ What does it taste like? It won't drink every day.		port
china	Good drink, with milk, explained below as mixed wine		port
china	It may be because of the bumps. A creamy liquid leaks under the unopened bottle cap. The taste is very fragrant. The question is: Can it still be drunk? Also, is there no seal in this wine lid?		port
china	Feeling is different from what I used to drink. I don't know if I'm not correct.		port
china	The price is good, and it is the same as the airport tax-free zone		port
china	Like to drink coffee and black tea, just add milk is nothing new, and just one day to see the ads, just want to try it. The taste of cream after drinking alone is very much liked, but the taste of wine is still very heavy, personally feel a bit awkward, 17% of alcohol is considered relatively high. Coffee with black tea is very good.	coffee cream coffeethin heavy	port
china	I feel too sweet, a bit tired, I don't like this kind of wine		port
china	Always used to buy this wine has always been 750ml This did not look to see his family cheaper to point the payment after the original is 330ml of the dead pit is poor Ten dollars difference is half the amount of alcohol is such a sloppy eye people shop Ten thousand note that I tasted the quality of this wine		port
china	The wine is not happy. It doesn't feel good to buy it. At least people don’t miss it.		port
china	It's okay to sit and drink. The packaging is very solid.		port
china	Out of curiosity, he tried to eat a barbecue while drinking it. He didn't spit it out. Later, he didn't eat it. He just tasted it, and he gradually tasted like whisky mixed with thick chocolate milk.		port
china	The smell is too pungent, like gasoline, too strong, I do not know if it is genuine.		port
china	Look: The bottle looks good, it's beautiful, it's elegant and elegant. It's good enough to please a woman. The liquor is creamy white. It's not as thick as normal wine. It's more like melted ice cream. The sweet smell of the cream is mixed with whiskey. Hard or stimulating, can only be said to have a great sense of shock, unique taste: single Baili sweet, then some of the tired, add some ice is much better. When the entrance is full of milk, the taste and smell of whisky fills the mouth and nose. Personally, I don’t particularly like cream, so I just tasted it.	cream cream creamelegant sweet creamy	port
china	The wine is not bad, the taste is smooth, suitable for self drinking		port
china	Under the statement, the difference is not to give items but to Amazon's distribution in Nanning Tenda Express! ! ! Poor attitude service difference poor system no place to complain Complaints no one finished management clearly stated door-to-door results floor high point would not be empty to call the customer to get good on their own is the cash on delivery is not very urgently needed things so it does not matter you Don't send me to complain! ! Big deal, don't! ! ! ! The result said that it did not send or wait for him to feel empty and send Tenda express this phenomenon is not once or twice! ! Amazon if you work in cooperation with them in Nanning, Guangxi, waiting to close! No one will be willing to buy your stuff no matter how cheap! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !		port
china	79 yuan to buy, it is suitable for the kind of mood do not want to drink beer and do not want to drink spirits.		port
china	I bought it long ago and it should be true. I remember that the packaging was particularly tight and I took the scissors for a long time.		port
china	Can not tell the feeling. But what I've been drinking before, I can't compare it. The sweetness is not enough.		port
china	The packaging is great, Amazon's packaging is very responsible, delivery must be as fast as ever.		port
china	Gabriel is suitable for you to drink a little at night ~ add some ice and sweet feeling ~		port
china	The super cute little bottle is still the first time I saw it. I used to buy a big bottle, I always liked the taste, chocolate plus whiskey, delicious and unique!		port
china	Good drink, rich cream. Not intoxicating. Well packaged, exactly the same as in the supermarket but half cheaper. Buy it later.	creamrich aged	port
china	For her husband's purchase, the amount of alcohol is not good, and it's good for milk. It's not bad, it feels like latte coffee.		port
china	The items I received are different from those in the pictures. I am not the main drinker. I mainly appreciate it. The outline labels I received are not beautiful.		port
china	The appearance of the bottle is slightly different, but the taste is fine and the aftertaste is a bit spicy		port
china	Wife used to send people, packaging is really mighty, it is estimated that the heart is not broken!		port
china	If I'm a drunkard, I just need this wine. The other tastes are great too!		port
china	There is nothing wrong with the packaging of the things. The taste is like the white liquor against some milk coffee. The taste of milk is the taste of milk, but there is a spicy feeling of white wine. It is not like very much.	coffeespicy thin icy	port
china	Although I don't like to eat sweet, it's really good to do ice cream or ice in the summer.	creamsweet	port
china	The entrance feeling is very texture, it is not suitable for women to drink directly, the feeling of spicy taste will make a lot of early loss of goodwill		port
china	Gabriel's taste is still very much like it. It's also good to add some ice cubes in summer.		port
china	I want to use it on Valentine's Day, so I will order it a few days in advance and I will send it to the day before work on Valentine's Day. . . Packaging is very good, professional, two bottles, protection is done well.		port
china	The family said it was good and tasted different tastes		port
china	More like it, but don't like the careful selection of coffee		port
china	Very sweet and bitter, it really is not suitable for drinking		port
china	The family did not try this wine, very good, very special		port
china	It's sweet, milk is sweet, it's silky and it's a bit too strong.		port
china	The taste is very strong, the taste is thick, is the taste of coffee, the smell is very sweet wine. I do not like sweet, but husbands who like sweets like it.	coffeesweet strong	port
china	The sweetness of the cream and chocolate is also very good. It means that I don’t have enough wine for me to drink. But after all, it’s not a drink. In short, it’s strongly recommended, especially for girls.	creamchocolate sweet short strong	port
china	The taste is a little sweet, rich milky, but I don't quite understand why alcohol is		port
china	Very good pre-dinner wine, creamy taste really good		port
china	The girl is more like this wine, the man is slightly sweeter		port
china	The taste of chocolate is not very high. Adding some ice cubes tastes good. Amazon's transportation service is in place, delivery to the door ~ haha		port
china	Did not drink alone, bought to match with Chivas, did not think it actually fit the taste! ! ! !		port
china	The seller's service attitude is very good, fast delivery and good after-sales service. Will patronize later. Thank you!		port
china	The point is that the packaging is also very good, a big box, a bunch of air bags inside, the bottle is also packed super good, really did not expect ah ~ great ~		port
china	His wife is very fond of, drink after dinner is also very good.		port
china	The taste is good, although not very suitable for direct drinking, but it is a good ingredient for fancy coffee		port
china	It's very tired, it's full of taste, and it's full of thick taste.		port
china	Did not drink sweet wine, when the 2.14 received, the time is just right! Drink with friends, all like it		port
china	To buy for my mother, I did not expect that people feel that the degree is not high enough, not to drink... or recommend to drink with ice in the summer, or too sticky		port
china	The wine tastes good, but it is like a small mouthful of drinking like drinking red wine.		port
china	Personal taste problem is not particularly like drinking this taste		port
china	Good taste, occasionally drink two very comfortable, first time drinking may not be accustomed to		port
china	It seems that the flavor of milk tea and liquor is not something that everyone likes, but it tastes okay. It tastes similar to what it used to buy. It should be authentic.		port
china	The packaging is very careful and not damaged. It is true, as it was bought before.		port
china	Friends party birthday to go out to play will be the first to buy a bottle of drink not drunk milk sweet. . . .		port
china	It tastes good as a good drink after the wine. Alcohol is a sweet milk. Nice friends also like it.		port
china	Buy a bottle to try, courier is still possible, not too slow, the wine is also good, ice and ice drink better, his wife liked it.		port
china	It is much cheaper than Wal-Mart and it's nice to accompany the ice cream!		port
china	The packaging is very good and the appearance is beautiful. It's good to drink.		port
china	This 750ml origin and production country are all Beijing, not imported, no wonder they taste different.		port
china	Since I met this wine, I liked it and I can't quit it. The newly installed ones haven't tried it yet. We haven't had a drink yet. We must maintain our standards.		port
china	I can't drink alcohol on my own. It's a bit of awkward drink. I recommend drinking 1-4 times more water. It feels like milk and sugar.		port
china	Express very fast ~ This is very satisfied ~ Not drink ~ Looks should be genuine ~		port
china	The white wine white wine on the bottle is different from the ice wine ice wine. There is also no sign of the VQA, and a bottle of sugar-added white wine sells this price. . .		riesling
china	Did not drink ice wine, do not know if it was (not before the comments that some people say is not ice wine, white wine is written in the lower right corner is not ice wine), so only talk about preferences, that taste can be, because I like a little degree of wine, this 15 degrees Very appetite, the stamina is considered too large in the wine, but the taste of alcohol is relatively heavy after opening the bottle, I do not know why, it may be a high degree. Some people may find it difficult to accept. When not lighting, the color of the wine is darker than the picture. Then there is the bottle stopper is not very good, the kind of special soft, it is easy to crack open, when the sea horse knife pulls out, it will crack, plug and pull out several times to finish playing, the buyer pays attention. Another: a hundred two bottles of income (like a double eleven buy)		riesling
china	The taste is good, the next time you will buy, Amazon service is good		riesling
china	Packaging the atmosphere, the bottle is very beautiful. The taste is very good, not bitter or astringent.		riesling
china	Aromatic wine taste rich. Long aftertaste, it is authentic Canadian ice wine.		riesling
china	It took a long time to drink more than half the bottle, and it didn't feel right.		riesling
china	Like the golden liquid in the transparent bottle, the result is not clear what liquid is seen in the dark green beer bottle, never seen this ice wine, lost beautiful, will not buy again		cabernet franc cabernet
china	The taste is great, with a sweet aftertaste of grapes and a hint of oak barrels. Worth tasting		cabernet franc cabernet
china	The baby received, the packaging looks good in the atmosphere, the most critical thing is pure taste, a shopping satisfaction		cabernet franc cabernet
uk	Six of this ...first tried at a recent function...and enjoyed by all there so much that I have stocked up for the July BBQs! Great value for money (IMO) at just a few pennies over a fiver a bottle, delivered (at the time of writing). They arrived impeccably packed for safe transit in individual cardboard wraps inside a sturdy, double-skinned carton. 2014 label ~ McGuigan ~ South Eastern Australia ~ 'Black Label' ~ Sauvignon Blanc ~ 12% Vol ~ 750 ml ~ Screw top It is exactly as the label states: ~ 'This is a full-flavoured wine with the classic varietal characters of passion fruit, cut grass and hints of peach. It is clean and crisp with generous flavours and a zesty lime finish. The perfect accompaniment to lighter style dishes, particularly seafood and fresh pasta'. For me, this pips the 2014 McGuigan CLASSIC Sauvignon Blanc, but only just - they are both great. ooOoo Manufacturer detail: 'McGuigan Wines was established to celebrate the culmination of 3 generations of wine growing by the McGuigan family.

uk	I bought this just before Christmas when it had an unexpected price drop. This wine is great (as are the Shiraz and Merlot) very drinkable and as I dont believe it is sold in the supermarket, it looks a little more premium to take over to a BBQ or dinner with friends. I would recommend adding this to the CamelCamelCamel website so that you can nab a case, or two, or three....... next time it drops in price.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Lovely wine, you can't go wrong with a McGuigans. I bought a case of 6, very moreish but it seems to have the side effect of causing you to wake up with a traffic cone on your head and marker pen all over you.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Both of us are not so keen on Sauvignon's which have an Oakey flavour. It was a really nice wine but didn't realise it wasn't what I would call a clean suavignon. If you like the Oak then this one is for you.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Long since drunk these bottles. not the best Sauvignon I have ever tasted but good for the vprice.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Easy drinking, light Sauvignon. We keep this in stock for parties and bbq's and the like.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Fine wine, good price, rubbish delivery. Delivery driver kept us waiting all day then knocked and disappeared not happy		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Spot on. Didn't last long though. Good for an everyday drinking wine. Great price though.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Just awful, asked for a refund as tastes foul. We buy a lot of sauvgnon blanc, never will but this again!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	I love McGuigan wines and this one didnt disappoint.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	This wine is just lovely! Bought a few cases in the black friday deals. £30 for 6 is a great price for this wine.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	this is a nice every day wine and at a good price. Would recommend trying it.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Sent as gift and had lovely tart taste .. Very much enjoyed!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	not brilliant, but an easy every day glass of wine.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	We brought this wine as we are forever buying a couple of bottles from the supermarket at a time and this was hit and miss. We wanted to buy a decent wine that was the same bottle and consistent. This is a very easy wine to drink. Best served quite chilled. Great value - even a friend who is a great wine drinker commented on the quality.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	With roots in the Hunter Valley from 1880, McGuigan wine has been produced in Southern Australia’s Barossa Valley since the late 1990s. The 2014 Black Label Sauvignon Blanc is presented in a screw capped bottle, which significantly reduces the potential for the wine to be corked, as well as making it so much easier to open the bottle! It’s priced at the entry level for Sauvignon Blanc but delivers far more than bottles I’ve had that retail at twice the price, so is unlikely to disappoint. I tend to gravitate towards dry white wines such as Chablis, Sancerre, Chardonnay and Burgundy and find some Sauvignon Blancs too close to medium for my taste. The 2014 McGuigan is refreshingly dry and crisp, served chilled it is perfectly suited to an evening in the garden relaxing after a hard day’s work. Try it with a simple pasta drizzled in olive oil and topped with a light grating of parmesan or crumbled goats cheese or just a plain salad; perfect.	olivefresh plain crisp dry light refreshing	sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	"I bought this on Amazon Prime Day for an absolute bargain price. Delivered the next day as always, and what can I say? They taste great! Obviously an Australian wine, it comes with a screw top lid and is available in most supermarkets here in the UK. At 12% it isn't the strongest of wines on the market, but for a white, it certainly has enough of a body to enjoy! The standard description: ""This is a full-flavoured wine with the classic characters of passionfruit, cut grass and hints of peach. It is clean and crisp with generous flavours and a zesty lime finish."" is pretty accurate. I definately get the passionfruit and the lime finish. Not sure about the cut grass though! All you need to remember is this won't be a wine that will blow your guests away at a dinner party, but it's the perfect bottle to take to an informal BBQ on a warm summers evening."	grass peach lime lime grasscrisp zesty lean clean strong	sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Very pleasant, great value. Perhaps not up to the standard of NZ Sauv Blanc (that's not a surprise) but the best Australian SB I've tasted, as good as most Chilean and fantastic value in this deal delivered to the door.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Not quite what I was expecting. Seems more like a dryish chardonnay with a bit of carbonated fizz added than a SV. Not in the same league as a reasonable NZ M SV like Mud or Brancott or Villa - which I only buy when on offer. It's drinkable but then so are many others wines. McGuigan used to do a chadonnay/viognier which was cheap and very drinkable. Still whatever makes your dingo happy!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	It matches the description and is pleasant to drink. I bought it on offer for under £ 5 per bottle. I would not pay the normal £ 7.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Excellent wine will definitely be ordering some more soon.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Very nice wine, on its own or with food. At the lightning deal of around £5 a bottle, really can't go wrong! Wish I'd ordered more from the deal		sauvignon blanc sauvignon

uk	Arrived promptly and as described. A gift so not tasted yet but the look lovely, thanks!		
uk	It was a gift for my cousins 18th But Leanne did say it was very nice . I will order again soon . Thank you .		
uk	yes I was so pleased with the price delivery and quality that I ordered it again		
uk	would not use again, did not deliver the item at all and then when I checked some time later they agreed it had not been sent , although I had an e-mail to say it was dispatched		
uk	We were sent this as a gift. But beware. the delivery company they use is dreadful. They only deliver Mon to Fri and can only give an 'all day' slot if you try to rebook. They wouldnt leave it unsigned for or at another address. I ended up having to take time off to go to the depot. So although when we got the product it looked nice and was well presented it was a real pain to get and took all the pleasure away. so if you are sending this you may need to consider how easy it is for your friend to get it. and I note ours is not the only delivery problem.		
uk	It was a gift for my daughter and son in law, they loved it		
uk	I purchased this gift for a friend and we enjoyed both of the wines together. They were both very easy drinking wines and the next time I have a gift to buy I will be coming back for more.		
uk	Great value (bought as a black Friday deal). Arrived in perfect condition and was a perfect, refreshing glass of sauvignon blanc. It went down well over Christmas. Would definitely buy again - especially when on offer.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon

uk	Quite delicious, as to be expected from the Jacob Creek stable.		chardonnay

uk	Not the best Chardonnay around, but pleasant and inexpensive.		chardonnay
uk	Best value for my money and enjoy having them delivered rather than have to carry them home or risk breakage.		chardonnay
uk	It could have oakier. Not a classy wine. Run of the mill.		chardonnay
uk	I love this wine but was a bit dissapointed about the delivery		chardonnay
uk	Not exactly to my taste, so not really fair to comment		chardonnay
uk	Brilliantly packaged and great tasting wine. Will buy again.		chardonnay
uk	I'm no wine buff, but this was pretty poor. A kind of 'thin' taste, and a definite and slightly unpleasant after-taste, possibly best described as 'chemically'. Have to admit, I bought on price - this was on offer, so thought it was worth a punt. Bought a case, but my wife and I could only drink two bottles. The rest will be used for cooking...		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Great price, the wine is alright, neither the best nor the worst I've had!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Just ok not as good as I had hoped for tasted quite cheap.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	It's OK! Slightly to acidic for me, vague melon notes was all I got out of this. At full price £5.95 don't bother there are better cheap Chardonnays around as a trip to Lidl will confirm, but for a fiver or less it's ok.		chardonnay
uk	Great wine and great price cant buy this in the shops and postage was free what a bargain		chardonnay
uk	Reasonable for the price but I don't think I shall reorder this wine		chardonnay
uk	Best chardonnay I've had. Smooth hints of peach and melon without being sweet to the taste.	peachsmooth sweet melon	chardonnay
uk	"I bought this during one of the Amazon lightning deals (although the price has remained low) - this is a budget Chardonnay and is perfectly drinkable. Amazon described 3 stars as representing ""It's okay"", 4 as ""I like it"" and 5 as ""I love it"". Perhaps others reviewing this wine have managed their expectations really well and genuinely ""love it"" but there's little to be excited about - its a fairly standard / mediocre Chardonnay. That's not to mean that its terrible - but its just ""okay"". I wouldn't pay full price for it as you'd probably get a better deal with another wine but if its on sale and you want a standard drinkable Chardonnay - then it's okay for that."		chardonnay
uk	The chardonnay has quite a distinctive taste. The oaky flavour wasn't for me, however, my other half loved it. Perhaps it is just down to personal taste. I can recommend the Black Label Pinot Grigio!		chardonnay
uk	McGuigan is always excellent and these are no exception. Good value and well packaged.		chardonnay
uk	Very nice wine, went down well with friends at my last party.		chardonnay
uk	One of my favourites! Great wine at a good price, and two quid a bottle cheaper than Morrisons, including delivery!		chardonnay
uk	Purchased on Prime Day on behalf of my parents who drink a lot of wine but aren't wine snobs. They like it.		chardonnay
uk	Superb product, would highly recommend this to anyone.		chardonnay
uk	What can I say, the wine is very nice much better than some of the other Mc Guigans wine.		chardonnay
uk	Only tried because of the prime promotion. Very average.		chardonnay
uk	Not what I expect of Chardonnay, but still good. Full of flavour		chardonnay
uk	Amazing wine!! One of my favourites. Great delivery.		chardonnay
uk	Fruity and dingy - good reliable example of NZ Sauv Blanc. Great price. Some adverts get the year wrong so watch out for that. Can't go wrong with these.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Had this Sauvignon Blanc at a local restaurant, my partner loved it. Really appreciated by my family at Christmas		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	beautiful wine and it came earlier for our dinner party, happy customer		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	I received year 2017, is not as good as other years from this brand		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	This wine is frankly amazing. We stumbled across this in Tesco on offer a year or so ago and have been buying it monthly ever since, so I feel I'm quite aware of pricing! Due to popularity it's risen in price from £8.75 to £9.50 in the last few months, but often goes on offer to £7.50 or so in the supermarkets. As soon as we saw an Amazon deal for £21 for 3x I knew I'd just buy it. Prime delivered in 24 hours and very well packaged so was happy with the delivery of the items and the price was superb. The wine is light and incredibly fruity, the clear/lightly green-tinted glass gives it a nice look, the only thing detracting from it at the moment is the Red Lions promotion currently on all the bottles - when it's not on there the wine clearly looks like a £10+ bottle, and dare I say tastes like a £15+ bottle. This will forever be in our wine rack.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	It had very attractive price on sale. May be less exotic in taste than other well known Marlborough Sauvignons. At the same time very pleasant with citrus and pineapple notes.	citrus pineapplecitrus apple	sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Nice, a good easy to drink white for those who don't really like the sharpness of most whites - so great if you are a Red drinker forced to drink white by your partner (not that this happens to me, I have complete control and never give in for an easy life)		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Got at a good price in the lightning sale and very pleased with . Got 2 lots for Christmas		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	My wife loves it and at this price too good to miss.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Disaster.. wine was so acidic it made a fizzy sound when opened! Sparkling when should of tasted smooth. I know this wine £6 good price but this selection was off! As Amazon don't refund on alcohol .. I was refunded the whole amount this time. Won't buy again alcohol. Pick up was arranged Amazon were supportive.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	I recommend this sauvignon blanc. Beautifully balanced and not too grassy or acidic. This is New Zealand sauvignon blanc and is much much better than sauvignon blanc from any other country.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	"Maybe it's just me but I didn't get ""intense aromas of nettles, melon and grapefruit"". I've never tried nettles... To me it tasted a bit too sweet with a hint of fizz and a little greenness (ie fresh fruits). I prefer Brancott Estate which manages to give alcohol, sweetness, dryness, a nice fizz and greenness. Whatever, Mudhouse SV is quite drinkable and has a fair amount of alcohol even though I can't taste it. Maybe longer in the bottle would be better. Edit: I bought it again but because Amazon currently offers it at an excellent price. This is a bargain price for NZ Marlborough SV. If only others would follow suit... Still a bit muddy but it gets less so when the price drops enough!"	grapefruitfresh green sweet dry melon	sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Great Marlborough Sauvignon. Definitely one of my favourites- very smooth.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	love it love it love it.. Should have bought more!!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Beautiful wine, very much like the popular Sunday bay as from same region. I defiantly commend		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Frustrated because it's a good wine but sweeter than it should be, 5* otherwise.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Good quality NZ Sauvignon Blanc, a bit lighter on the acid than some and less distinctive but very pleasant		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	I love the description of how lovingly the wine is made. From the careful handling of the grapes in the vineyard, to the skill and care used in the winery. The only step that's missing is the bulk tanker shipping, UK bottling and the massive amount of SO2 that is required to keep a wine fresh under these conditions. All said though the wine tastes ok, but I wouldn't pay more than £7-8 a bottle.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	✤ BRANCOTT ESTATE ✤ MARLBOROUGH ✤ SAUVIGNON BLANC ✤ 75 cl ~ New Zealand This used to be one of my favourites of all time but, based on the last few experiences I have had, both via ‘Amazon Pantry’ & elsewhere, the 2016 label is more ‘tropical’ in taste for my liking and a tad ‘zesty’ in the mouth. Not a great year, I guess? It happens...roll out the next one!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	Really nice, only problem with this wine is it can give me a little heart burn but it is nice and refreshing.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	The bottles come in labelled with Brancott Estate 2015 on the safety wrapping They are 2016. False Advertising.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon
uk	One of my favourite New Zealand whites, very reliable drop that always goes down a treat. A bit fruitier and sharper, with more gooseberry flavour than the ever popular Villa Maria. A bit too easy to drink is probably the only bad thing I can say about it.	gooseberrythin berry sharp gooseberry	sauvignon blanc sauvignon

uk	Ive just tried my first bottle of the 2014 vintage. For me it's too sharp when it's young and really benefits from a little longer in bottle. If you have the required patience it would be interesting to try one bottle now and another next year when it'll have rounded out a little flavour wise and lost some of the scorching acidity.....		sauvignon blanc sauvignon

uk	...at just over four pounds (at the time of writing). ❅ PINOT GRIGIO ❅ WINE of MOLDOVA ❅ 2016 ❅ 12.5% Vol ~ DRY : 2 ~ SCREW TOP More expensive brands have proved to be quite disappointing, to me, lately, but this is a very good value Pinot Grigio, from Moldova, which, nicely chilled, made a great accompaniment to light bites at a recent function in front of a roaring fire! I liked it so much I bought my own from 'Amazon Pantry'. It came wrapped in a net jacket safely in the midst of the various other goodies in the sturdy cardboard carton. I like the fact that Morrison’s have a 1-9 guide from very dry to sweet, with this being a ‘2’. In a clear glass bottle with a freshly coloured label in BLACK & GREEN with WHITE lettering, the straw-coloured wine is dry but light with an apple & mild citrus-y tone and a remarkably crisp finish. It is back in my basket for next time! [10 images refer]	applefresh citrus crisp green apple sweet dry light raw mild	pinot grigio
uk	I ordered a bottle of pinot wine, but received two. The wine is fine, but I'm fed up with getting my orders duplicated,especially as I'm paying for the extra goods!		pinot grigio
uk	I do not usually write reviews but this wine is excellent for money. Great taste and value.		pinot grigio
uk	I don't drink but everyone else seemed to like this wine and got quite happily tipsy on it....		pinot grigio
uk	Would definitely buy again ... do note it's 12.5% though!		pinot grigio
uk	The wife didn't like the taste. Using it for cooking now.		pinot grigio
uk	Now whilst I don't subscribe to over indulgence of alcohol, this wonderful wine is almost irresistible to put down, when served well chilled. Rich and fresh tasting, with plenty of fruit, and a lovely aftertaste. We were lucky to buy these on offer, but will happily buy them at other times, as required. So many supermarket Pinot’s are to sharp, and IMHO harsh. This one seems a great balance, and makes for a very refreshing and moreish drink. Cheers		pinot grigio
uk	dont like white rubbish, this was for my wife as she wants people to think she drinks a lot of water as she pours it into water bottles - amazingly!		pinot grigio
uk	A decent Pinot for the price, not as dry as I would have liked		pinot grigio
uk	Every body to their own. Fabulous taste. Not to be shared.		pinot grigio
uk	For anyone who enjoys Pinot, this is an excellent choice.		pinot grigio
uk	nice little easy drinking wine that tastes more expensive than the price tag i've set up a subscription for it		pinot grigio
uk	A lovely, light wine with a very clean taste. I bought these and served them at my wedding. The guests loved it.		pinot grigio
uk	Great value . Actually better value than the local supermarkets		pinot grigio
uk	Lovely dry wine. Great for drinking with fish, chicken, or just on its own. Serve chilled for a summer treat! Bought in a deal, so very happy. Would buy again.		pinot grigio
uk	I love really crisp wines and this Pinot Grigio certainly puts a big tick in that box. Will definitely be back for more		pinot grigio
uk	Purchased on Prime Day on behalf of my parents who drink a lot of wine but aren't wine snobs. They like it.		pinot grigio
uk	Such lovely wine, my favourite Pinot Grigio by a mile.		pinot grigio
uk	Its alright, but my word did I have a headache after the 5th bottle. I may not drink number 6 for a few days.		pinot grigio
uk	Just opened a bottle . It's a lovely refreshing wine		pinot grigio
uk	I ordered a range of the Echo Falls wine for a girls weekend. They all went and there were no complaints. I wish I could tell you more about the taste but after a cocktail making class, I was an easy sell :)		
uk	Worth trying but I cannot see myself buying this again. I thought it lacked the mango taste. It tasted fake, not real.		
uk	I loved this but my husband found it very sweet. I dont like wine generally, but could quite easily have this.		
uk	Excellent Wine, but ruined by the overpowering extra flavours. Was not liked or finished.		
uk	This is very tasty, much fruitier than standard wine which I really like especially when the sun is shining (which sadly isn't very often) I love wine anyway but sometimes like a fruitier tasting wine for longer drink when sitting in the garden and this is ideal for just that! It is also slightly weaker than standard wine at 9% not that you can tell but helps when enjoying it in the garden, this is also great for mixing with ice and lemonade for a long cocktail style drink and tastes really nice too. The bottle looks just like any other wine and is of the usual echo falls excellent quality, very very nice, now we just need more sun!		
uk	In hindsight I shouldn't have taken wine advice form an 18 year old in the Mace shop where I bought this. This stuff is synthetic and vile. It went straight down the sink.		
uk	Some idiots reviews, clearly think they're somethin		
uk	Wine arrived very promptly and as usual is very good. Will be ordering again soon!		
uk	I love this wine light crisp refreshing though can be variable as in sometimes seems little acidic despite that still love it		
uk	Started to worry when I read some of the other reviews but also needed a quick delivery of some Vidal. I ignored the 3 reviews from 2015, as after all this is a 2016 wine! Amazon you need to address this issue of reviews being posted on products incorrectly. This wine is excellent and very refreshing and bursting with flavour. It arrived well packaged, on time and totally as described. My only gripe (no pun intended) is the inaccuracy of reviews.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	Wine dispatched to me was different to that shown in picture and was 12.5% alcohol not 13% as advertised and expected. I was informed that I would receive a refund for this, but to date nothing has been received.	datethin	sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	The product I received was different too. Was disappointed but I don't think that the taste is too bad. However, as this is non refundable (& I ordered 3 boxes) I do think that customers should have been notified there was a difference and given the option to continue with the purchase. I probably would have ordered 1 box to try and then the other 2, they came as 3 separate deliveries anyway.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	Very good crisp example of sauvignon blanc. Excellent minerality. Recommended.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	If you love Cloudy Bay, you'll love this, especially the price diffrence!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	Bought as a Christmas present for a friend, who loves this wine!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	First tasted this wine in London after tasting so much rubbish. It's lovely refreshing wine and not cheap but neither is it too expensive		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	The product ordered and the product delivered are different. The product delivered is no way near as good. Avoid!		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal
uk	Arrived on time BUT delivered 5 bottles out of 6 ordered! the box was damanged badly and wet and bottles were sticking out of the box! Considering strong smell of alcohol I was prepared for disappointment. Positive is -it's taste as I know it-5 STAR. I wish they have different rating for shipment and product. I have ordered 3 more boxes, taking the risk, as I really like the product, and packaging of these boxes was perfect. Negative reviews based on quality of the wine made me to update my review.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon vidal

uk	Great tasting wine and it is one of my favourites as it is on the sweeter side and isn't dry. However, it is overpriced and ASDA sell it for £7		riesling
uk	Bought for some friends who will not drink anything else! On the sweet side for me!		riesling
uk	Very fruity with a dry aftertaste. In a bit more detail the first sip is sweet and boisterous. Perfectly drinkable but make sure it is well chilled. The sweetness settles down and you can taste the fruitiness in more detail, there is a hint of apple and orchard fruit. After swallowing there is a lingering after taste, mostly dry with a bit of a tang, in contrast to the initial taste. I drink Riesling and Chenin Blanc as my usuals, this is a very good tipple. Bottle is well presented and delivery is in a secure polystyrene so very little risk of breaking. For the price though, I really don't feel it's amazing value. For £10 you'd be very happy. However by all means do try it, it's a good wine and goes down very well.	applefruity apple sweet dry	riesling
uk	I'm rather fond of a Riesling, and, although this is not the nicest bottle I've ever drunk, it was certainly a pleasant tipple. Its quite a punchy sweet mouthful on first sampling, and I did worry it was going to be a bit too tart to enjoy, but if you let it sit on the palette for a moment or two it opens up into a much richer, fuller flavoured, apply sort of taste, with a tangy, drier aftertaste. It's certainly worth a go if you like a reasonably sweet, fruity wine.		riesling
uk	As you would expect, the taste, aroma and finish of this Riesling is a cut above the kind of wines you`ll pay half the price for. If you have something special planned, or just fancy an indulgent evening and a nice bottle of white with some spicy foods - the sweetness of this really complements such dishes - then this is an excellent choice.		riesling
uk	I'm a big fan of Riesing wine and this one didn't disappoint. A refreshing wine that, although a little drier than I would normally go for, still delivered and is perfect either to drink on its own or paired with food. Very enjoyable!		riesling
uk	It's a good bottle at the price, and unlike many rieslings, it stands alone rather than necessarily being a wine-with-food. I prefer Riesling to edge a little towards the sweet, and this does that, with some nice floral/appley tones.		riesling
uk	Being unable to drink alcohol I passed this on to my parents you very much enjoyed the quality and flavour. I think.		riesling
uk	Quite drinkable drop of wine with a nice balance of sweetness and acidity but with lower tannins than a cabernet. This is not unusual since my experience is that low priced Merlot tends to be a lot more drinkable than other grape varieties. The internal packaging is not recyclable but the cardboard is. I suspect that this is offset by the lower environmental impact due to lower weight and less transport costs. I know it's considered sacrilege to chill red wines but not so much for a cheaper one as long as it is robust enough to survive the flavour dampening effect of the lower temperatures and this wine is. If you do put it in the fridge after opening it lasts for a week or two without tasting corked. Very refreshing on a warm summers day when chilled.		merlot
uk	Not bad at all, served at the right temperature there are no tannins on the nose or tongue. Like most budget Merlots it lacks the slightly smokey after taste but it's full bodied and pleasant enough. Good value for money.		merlot
uk	JP Chenet is the top selling brand of French wine and is easily recognised in it's distinctive wide-bodied bottle with the bent neck – a design known affectionately as Josephine. I was lucky enough to purchase this JP Chenet Merlot 2014 Wine 75 cl (Case of 6) as an Amazon Lightning Deal but even at the regular price it works out at around only a fiver a bottle. Unlike most bottles of Chenet – and French wine in general – this variety comes with a screw-top rather than a cork. I generally enjoy Chenet and it is a brand I normally buy when in France, however this 2014 Merlot is not one of the best of their's I've tried although it is reasonable enough for the price. A drinkable Merlot but far from a classic vintage – four stars at the price.		merlot
uk	As always this merlot from JB Chenet is excellent. This is the 2nd batch I have had and will certainly be ordering again when necessary. A truly nice wine.		merlot
uk	Already started drinking. Lovely. I have ordered the low alcohol sparking rose, this dispatch of red, and my next order will be bottles of white. Good quality wines at great prices for the quality.	rosetar rose tart	merlot
uk	A very good Merlot and the price was unbelievably low. I think I got a great deal.		merlot
uk	Excellent Wine, personally I love this. Nice and Fruity, hint of spice. But mellow enough to enjoy on its own.	spicefruity mellow	merlot
uk	Fantastic wine at an even more fantastic price for 6 bottles it is a lovely taste would recommend.		merlot
uk	Order arrived leaking all over our hall carbet! Not happy!		merlot
uk	God its awful. i usually like JP wine but this tastes chemically and watered down. even when put through an aerator and decanted for nearly 2 hours this is rubbish.not even any good for cooking. Amazon were good though and refunded me without question. my other concern is that it has screw tops now..i thought all full sized bottles of jp wines are still corked.		merlot
uk	Bought two cases of this, as it is a very drinkable wine at a reasonable price. I have bought for an upcoming party.		merlot
uk	This wine has been consistently good for a couple of years now - I live in France and always bought it as a favourite - now they have changed the packaging and the wine is not so good - maybe a bad harvest... would not recommend at the moment - I'm on the lookout for a new favourite !!		merlot
uk	Great tasting wine at a bargain price, got them for around £4 a bottle on an Amazon Lightning Deal !		merlot
uk	Arrived well packaged. I normally order Merlot but like Hardys so thought I'd try --- WOW I'm glad I did because its now my Favourite blend of grape and I live this taste and even buy the same year each time-- it is truly a pleasure, can be drunk happily alone or with food but it is Very hard to stop!!!!!!		merlot cabernet cabernet merlot

uk	I enjoy a full bodied red wine. I prefer Chilean producers and I like something that's priced to both enjoy and use without thinking about cost. Any of the Casillero del Diablo reds hit that spot. Based on traditional methods and generations of experience, this is a producer which has moved with the times to deliver great tasting, good value plonk there's no acidic afterburn, the cherry and black currant fruit taste are there, it's a robust, full bodied glass of red which will sit happily with a lasagne or casserole. Or, even better, as a room temp drink to help the cook'sprep. Simply, it's a really good value red. Full of distinct flavours, without excess acidity and one of my favourite stock 'red'. Just make sure to serve at room temp to really bring out the taste.	cherryburn thin lean acidic robust	cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	...that always goes down well on ‘Lasagne Night’. Smooth; medium-full bodied; cassis & black cherry with a hint of coffee, dark chocolate & a tiny bit of spice on the fade, to me. ※ CASILLERO DEL DIABLO ※ CABERNET SAUVIGNON ※ CHILE ‘AGED IN AMERICAN OAK BARRELS’ 13.5 % Vol Worth shopping around for, but this (2015) is a great price from Amazon Pantry (£6 currently), and was also one of the eligible items for the ‘free first box delivery offer’ when I last ordered, so a very good excuse to get more than one bottle! It comes in an elegant bottle with the RED top, to distinguish from the GREY-topped MALBEC , the latter for those nights when a sirloin steak needs some company.	cherry coffee spiceelegant smooth chocolate aged cassis round	cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet

uk	One of our favorites but can be hit or miss when buying from the market. Luckily, the bottles we got from Amazon were all excellent.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Either they have very different batches (which would not surprise me considering how many they produce) or my wine taste is totally different from other reviewers, but I did not enjoy this wine a single bit. I am not a wine snob and often find decent wines for the same price or maybe a bit more, and unlike that guy from Sideways usually like Merlot for easy-drinking taste. But unfortunately I did not find this wine to be easy-drinking, the taste was rather sharp and very lemony, almost acidic, which overwhelmed all other notes, if there were any. That's just a personal opinion of course and feel free to try it for yourself.		merlot
uk	I tend to favour Australian Merlots and this one is by far my favourite at the moment. To my amateur tastebuds (shush, they think they're professionals) this merlot tastes like plums. It's got an intense taste that is also light and delicious on its own or with dinner (pasta, red meat, a microwaved Waitrose special...) The description says it's 11% but the bottle says it's 13.5%. It feels like 13.5% is accurate. Delicious wine and I ordered a second case.		merlot
uk	"A very easy and pleasant wine to drink. I bought this case of wine when it was first on offer. I am not a red wine drinker but my husband is. I looked at the reviews before buying and it appealed to me that that most people described it as ""easy"" or ""pleasant"". He confirmed that it was a none thinking enjoyable wine. Since buying a number of bottles he has actually gone off some of the more expensive wines that he use to enjoy. The only niggle I have is that they seem to be increasing the price each time we buy."		merlot
uk	Oh my. Taste, equals amazing. After taste lush. Smooth. A very good purchase. If you haven't tried this. Give this a try. I'll be coming back with this one.		merlot
uk	Extremely smoothe and very palatable. There are a number of good Merlots about and this I rate as one of the best. And it comes at a really good price (circa £6 per bottle delivered).		merlot
uk	Nice smooth wine, at 13.5%Vol it may be perhaps a bit heavy for some. So far always found wine has a consistant taste and Quality with the fruit and oak flavours. Not a wine buff, but know what I like, and I Like!		merlot
uk	Not overly keen on this wine although it has won awards. It's ok but I think it tastes more like a shiraz than a merlot, but hey, I'm no expert or connoisseur. I have, however, been drinking red wine for a good few years and know what I like.		merlot
uk	Got these under a good offer with Amazon on Subscribe and Save = they were great for the price and tasting great. Watch out as my next order they have gone up by £10 and there are better wines out there for that overall cost.		merlot
uk	Love this wine so when I saw it advertised for £32.99 and free post I reordered.But all changed on invice and ended up paying £5 more so not happy.Be careful .		merlot
uk	Merlot is one of our favourites but this was nowhere near the quality of the McGuigan Red so were a bit disappointed.		merlot
uk	A lovely red. Easy to drink and exactly what you would expect from a merlot. I served this at my wedding reception and the guests loved it.		merlot
uk	Super easy drinking wine, but still complex enough for the more experienced palate		merlot
uk	excellent wine - my complete and utter favourite but unfortunately the price has steadily been rising!		merlot

uk	I'm not a big wine drinker but my other half enjoys a few glasses some times, so they were for her (Brownie points for me) though I did sample some as she said how nice it was, and I must agree this was a purchase that we both enjoyed, so will be buying some more soon!		merlot
uk	Since tending to drink Prosecco not sure if I still have a taste for red wine?? In the past usually drank red rather than white, but been drinking Prosecco for about 12 months. Tried this and don't particularly like it, will have to try some other red, (what an excuse), to see if my taste has changed.		merlot
uk	Very nice smooth, slightly sweet merlot with a decent amount of body. I enjoyed this a lot. Very easy to drink and like. Will go well with many foods including fish, chicken and red meat. Currently at a good price too. Go for it!		merlot
uk	Nice wine at a good price on a lightening deal. Deals like this are now getting as good as if not better than supermarket loss leading promos. The wine itself is a good flavoured easy drinker. Would easily buy again.		merlot
uk	This is my favourite all time wine! It's so smooth to drink, soft fruity flavours, no bitter aftertaste. It goes down very easily and has the added bonus of no headaches the next morning!! We have also tried McGuigan Black Label Red, and Black Label Shiraz, these are also very good smooth wines, but we do prefer the Merlot.		merlot

uk	"This case of six bottles contains McGuigan Black Label Merlot in 75cl size. Advertised as ""... soft and flavoursome wine with ripe fruit flavour of raspberry, cherry and plums"" combined with the fact that I have tried and enjoyed other McGuigan wines made me want to explore and expand my wine pallet. From the region of Australian's Capital Territory it has won a number of awards which is pretty remarkable considering the low price per bottle. Australian merlots do come in a lot of styles, this one I enjoyed reasonably well (especially with chicken). However it is not the best wine of the region nor the style I have tasted. While it was smooth and palatable enough it just didn't meet my expectations in terms of flavour. The saving grace is the low cost and that it is easy to drink (while lower in tannins). Personally I preferred the Shiraz and Sauvie however this Merlot will keep most people happy and works well with several different food types as well as a casual or social wine to drink by itself..."	raspberry cherryberry ripe smooth soft	merlot

uk	A truly wonderful wine, bursting with flavour and not heavy. bought from Amazon deals at an unbeatable price.		merlot
uk	Excellent value for money, wine was excellent as I am a fan of mcguigan wines.		merlot
uk	One of the nicest reds I've had, I will definitely be buying more of this!!		merlot
uk	Decent bottle of red. Have tried McGuigan's wines in the past and found them to be good but taste of course is personal. What I would say is that the price doesn't look that much different than what you might find in your local supermarket. Vine reviewers get a single bottle so the packaging is different but if the six pack is the same standard as the single one then you shouldn't have problems. This was well packed in a polystyrene cylinder inside a cardboard box. Not sure what happens if something like this gets damaged in the post having never ordered wine from Amazon.		merlot
uk	Delicious. Bought on recommendation. Did not fail to please.		merlot
uk	I have to be honest I generally prefer white wine. So my tastebuds are kind of hardwired to sweet, white. I found this okay but not spectacular. I was hoping for something that tasted a lot more fruity. If you like reds it would be worth a try, it had no tanniny aftertaste which is a bonus. If you're a committed white wine drinker I would avoid.		merlot
uk	For what it is and the price, this is an enjoyable and easy-drinking red wine. Recommended		merlot
uk	Beautiful full bodied wine..for the price...can't be beat.		merlot

uk	Very impressed with the delivery and price of this port. It arrived within 48 hours. Packaged superbly. I'm housebound and wanted this particular port as a gift for my partner. The price on this including delivery is pretty much the same as if I'd gone to a major supermarket. Fabulous! So thrilled Amazon had it and the delivery was so quick! Also really great it comes boxed in the Taylors port packaging. Makes it look really smart if it is a gift. Highly recommended. My man was really happy.		port

uk	Really disappointed - I bought this as a birthday present for a friend, didn't open the packaging until it was time to wrap it and the lid to the 'presentation' box (which was packed inside two other boxes) was ripped in several places. It looked awful and I had to take the bottle out to give to my friend - it would have looked so much nicer in the box.		port

It came as a single bottle, without the box in the photo. This review is not indicative of the quality of the wine, which I do commend. The seller would be remiss if they did not alter the photo and description of this product, and issue apologies.		port
uk	Excellent service. Exclemt product. Could not fault.		port
uk	Brought for a present, it was very well received, I was told it tasted very nice.		port
uk	Excellent seller&product-fast delivery -5star-would definitely use again-		port
uk	Lovely port was bout to accompany a bandy which is did well..nice rich taste.		port
uk	A very tasty bottle of Port. Made for a nice Valentine's drink.		port
uk	exceptionally well packed and delivered as promised		port
uk	This is a lovely drink and an excellent Christmas present for young and old alike. I strongly recommend it to you.		port
uk	Bought for my brother-in-law who enjoyed it immensely---as did the rest of the family, much to his light-hearted irritation !		port
uk	Part of a present - but I know it will be readily drank and enjoyed after dinner		port
uk	Disappointed item has not arrived with the box as pictured.		port
uk	Disappointed this didn't come with the box as advertiseductive in the picture. Was for a present.		port
uk	Tried for the first time and love it. Warms up the chest NICELY. My winter friend :)		port
uk	Taylors always delivers fine port. this was bought as a gift for my Brother in law as it is one of his favourites.		port
uk	Arrived safely and well packaged, A very well received christmas present went down very well with the port sipper glasses, I would recommend buying them together		port
uk	Product is great, but took a long time to arrive. It was a gift.		port
uk	Bought as a present so have not yet heard a reaction but as I have sampled the same product I am sure it will be well received.		port
uk	OK for the price but...Was on sale at Tesco so I checked reviews on amazon... all good so I bought it. I must say I am a bit disappointing. Was expecting more. It leaves a spicy/sour aftertaste. You get used to it eventually but definitely worth spending £7 more and getting the 10Y Tawny one. I'm a great lover of port wine. I once went to get water and came back with 5 bottles as they were at 50% off..and goes well with my cigars. This is for sure the worst I had so far. I'll be sticking to 10-20y tawny ones from now one.		port
uk	This was a gift, ordered from Australia. Very easy to order and received well by the recipient. Many thanks.		port
uk	Received these in good time. I have only taken them a couple of times and they have helped no end with my constipation but had no luck with weightloss but I think if taken properly they will.		port
uk	Purchased for a friend who likes the port, not tried it myself		port
uk	£12 in Sainsbury. Same lovely taste wherever you buy it.		port
uk	Too sweet. May I recommend La Mancha wines - excellent oak- aged wines for about a third of the price of wines of other more famous regions. The wines of Extremedura are also excellent.		malbec
uk	Have ordered this at least 3 times. However the most recent batch was of a different quality and taste.. Very sweet and not that nice.. Appears that the good stuff has run out and now any old grape juice will do.. I won't be buying again.		malbec
uk	Smooth, good quality Malbec. Excellent value for the price. Have tried many Malbecs and this one takes some beating.		malbec
uk	I don't know! It just arrived (on time and intact but in a battered box according to 'er indoors) and I'm not at home yet! Don't put me under so much pressure. OK! OK! I'll give it a middle of the road 3 for starters and will adjust accordingly when I can get my taste buds around it. But I'm looking forward for sure as I also have a few bottles of Argie Malbec to conduct an official 'Argentina v Australia' taste test. It's going to be epic... I hope. Watch this space.		malbec
uk	Lovely wine, very smooth, tastes slightly sweet with cheese for a nice contrast. Definately want more of these.		malbec
uk	Not sure about this wine initially, thought it tasted thin. I was wrong. After two bottles it’s grown in me and I recommend it.		malbec
uk	Not as decribed in the product text and photo of the bottle. Advertised as 13%, but bottles delivered were 12.5%,		malbec
uk	Bought this for my Dad, he loves it, says it's great quality and tastes good, good VFM!		malbec
uk	This is the nicest red wine I have ever had. What more can I say. It is soft and beautiful, I'm no wine conniseur but this stuff is so drinkable. No horrid tannin tangy taste. Shame I only got 6 on prime day.		malbec
uk	Lovely wine, and a very good price...well done McGuigan		malbec
uk	Far too soft and fruity for a wine usually chosen to go with a nice steak.		malbec
uk	Bought on a lightning deal. Keeps the husband quiet for a bit so all good!!		malbec
uk	This is a delicious wine, quite fruity and heavy - so perfect if you like a full bodied wine. Doesn't have the soft finish of the Black Label 'red' though.		malbec
uk	well its nice wine what else is there - the case should last a day or two:), unless you want endless drivel about the taste on your palate etc, its nice with a meal or after to chill.		malbec
uk	always a favourite red wine. I like the black label in this brand		malbec
uk	Not my favourite mcguigan but taste is subjective and worth a punt if on offer		malbec
uk	All tastes are different but I found it quite pleasant. For the price its better than some which cost a lot more.		malbec
uk	Very nice wine, as good as the £10 bottles from Sainsbury's so a bargain when on offer :)		malbec
uk	I thought it was pleasant, one of our guests absolutely loved it! All a matter of taste preference		malbec
uk	This wine does not disappoint very consistant in taste and would recommend it to anyone		malbec
uk	One of our favourite wines. Trouble is it doesn't last very long Well packaged and delivered on time		malbec
uk	took almost 2 months to deliver , taste ok but not the best		malbec
uk	Lovely rich flavoured wine with spiced fruit and chocolate coming through. Not bitter at all. Nice.		malbec
uk	Lovely fruity great after taste, wish I had bought more.		malbec
uk	2011 (what a great year for Rioja and Chianti) 2012 (?) marginally not as much. A nice wine, at a nice price, but if it's supposed to be 2011 then that's what I expect to get, not the 2012 I received. 3 stars .......... deserves four for the 2011 it should have been.		
uk	It states 2011 as the year, but I had 2012 delivered.		
uk	muey bien.a superb tipple. its a no brainer when price discounted. might even be worth paying normal price for it ...... and thats from a Yorkshire man!		
uk	Execellent wine for a an excellent price, cant go wrong buying this wine for £6:49 a bottle		
uk	Hubby is really fussy with red wine and normally avoids anything Spanish - but he loves this!		
uk	Efficient delivery very acceptable wine at a very competitive price		
uk	Very nice wine. Came extremely fast im really happy thanks		
uk	Cracking wine. Love it even more when it's on offer.		
uk	Thought this was a good deal but after taking delivery I discovered that Sainsbury's are doing them at the same unit price but with a further 25% off for six. Buyer beware! Lovely wine though and almost worth any price.		
uk	Unfortunately, the wine is past its sell buy date. There's a hint of fruit, but more so a sour note. Bought this product with great anticipation, but I've opened two bottles and both are the same.	datesour	
uk	This is now a firm favourite in my house. I am always buying wine from the supermarket or the local shop, opening it and being disappointed. I bought a bottle of this from the Co-op at nearly £9 and really loved it...then decided to go searching to see if I could get it for a better price on line...low and behold Amazon have it at considerably more reasonable price! It's delicious, sort of raspberry and cherry flavoured, with a warm spice. I'm not a wine expert but I know what I like and what I do not like...this one's a winner!	raspberry cherry spiceberry firm	shiraz
uk	Yum -very lovely and fruity wine, only problem is it evaporates my glass always needs refilling!!!		shiraz
uk	It's dangerous to sell wine this good for this price, were on our second box now.		shiraz
uk	I'm not sure if the other reviewers are drinking the same wine as this is really quite vinegary and frankly terrible. Yes, it's cheap, but that doesn't mean it's drinkable. Try others around the same price range such as Hardys Nottage Hill Cabernet Shiraz and you will see a massive difference.		shiraz
uk	Great value especially when bought on today's specials		shiraz
uk	I bought this just before Christmas when it had an unexpected price drop. This wine is great (as are the Merlot and Sauvie) very drinkable and as I don't believe it is sold in the supermarket, it looks a little more premium to take over to a BBQ or dinner with friends. I would recommend adding this to the CamelCamelCamel website so that you can nab a case, or two, or three....... next time it drops in price.		shiraz
uk	One of our favourite wines and seemed to taste better as we had an offer on it!!!!!!!		shiraz
uk	Great tasting, great quality wine - you will not be disappointed.		shiraz
uk	What can I say, its red wine. Good flavour But (& its a serious but ) I'm sure the bottles are getting smaller cos it doesn't last long :)		shiraz
uk	Bought for my husband for Christmas - fourth lot now - loves it Great price, great quality wine		shiraz
uk	Love this wine. Good to drink on its own too but fantastic with meat dishes.		shiraz
uk	My favourite wine, smooth and full bodied. Friends are in awe of it, taking pics of the label etc. Get this at the right temperature and you will not be disappointed. Occasionally it'son offer and then it tastes even better, if that is even possible!		shiraz
uk	£7.50 more than a bargain. We drink a lot of red wine and don’t do the <£10 bottles, but will easily buy more even though I’m a Cabernet S man!		shiraz
uk	AMENDED REVIEW. BY SEARCHING THE AMAZON SITE I FOUND A PAGE TO ENTER MY TELEPHONE NUMBER, WITHIN SECONDS I RECEIVED A CALL FROM ABBY V WHO WITHIN MINUTES EFFICIENTLY DEALT WITH THE QUERY ON MY BEHALF. WELL DONE AMAZON. I CAN NOW ENJOY MY FAVOURITE McGUIGAN SHIRAZ.		shiraz

uk	Bought this based on the good product review and was not let down - a very nice drop!!		shiraz
uk	great price, fab tasting wine. Will order again at this price		shiraz
uk	This is a lovely wine - and I got lucky with the price! I know it's Australian - but really, it's good! Nicely balanced with great flavours.		shiraz
uk	A Fantastic shiraz. Really enjoyed this and at the bargain price on prime day. Will definately buy more of this top notch wine.		shiraz
uk	This wine is loverly, a bit easy to brink though....not sure I should buy it in bulk!		shiraz
uk	This is one of my favourite red wines, it has a lovely, well bodied and fruity flavour. It isn't too heavy and and extremely smooth. Highly Recommended.		shiraz
uk	Good wine bought when on offer so great price as well!		shiraz
uk	One of my favourite wines and had this offer at half the price which was on for one day only! Delighted!!!		shiraz

uk	Terrific value for money, but you have to be quick.		shiraz
uk	Another cheap bad wine. (Can be used for mulled wine, or in recipes)		shiraz
uk	very nice wine not too strong but hits the spot CHEERS		shiraz
uk	fruity, easy drinking - nice glass of wine - recommended		shiraz
uk	Brilliant service and brilliant wine will buy again,		shiraz
uk	I wanted to like this wine. I am not a fan of Mc Guigan wines at the best of times but I thought I would give this 'Black Label' Shiraz a go. I wish I hadn't bothered. It was most disappointing: thin, a little too sweet, with no real depth or character at all. I can only say it lived up to earlier recollections of this second rate wine maker. Unless you have no tastebuds I would recommend passing on this one.		shiraz
uk	I have been buying these boxes of wine for a while now with no problem .I opened one box and stored the other To my horror last night when I went for the other it had leaked everywhere (at the bottom of my wadrobe.)The pine is soaked and my clothes smellclike dirty beer mats .Please get in touch to get this situation solved .I have no problem with your wine just the way that it was delivered.Tania g.		chardonnay colombard
uk	Both boxes of white wine were packaged over 1 year ago, and boxed wine only keeps for up to 1year. I drained them both down the sink, and wine was a very dark colour, completely undrinkable. Took me weeks to get refund.		chardonnay colombard
uk	Love this wine - not always easily available in supermarkets - so this 3L box fits nicely in the fridge - drip proof dispensing nozzle - and will last you a few days (!)		chardonnay colombard
uk	Value for Money, quite reasonable and on time delivery		chardonnay colombard
uk	Not a bad wine at all & also the fact it`s delivered to your door the next day, it has to be worth 5 stars!! :) : )		chardonnay colombard
uk	I really like his wine. It's nice a crisp and great value for money too.		chardonnay colombard
uk	wonderful wine first had this in British Airways first class lounge - yummy Be aware if you work that you need to sign for this and be in - I could not have this delivered to my neighbours so had to wait a number of dasys.		
uk	Lacked depth & complexity. There are better wines for this price point.		
uk	Smooth clean taste with chocolate backnotes. Lovely with steak or mushrooms. Speedy delivery and not overpackaged		
uk	Being a lover of red wine, I bought this on a recommendation and can honestly say that while it is a good enough wine, I have had far better at a third of the price		
uk	I bought one of these on a lightning deal and another at full price as I needed a couple of bottles of decent plonk for the Sunday roast. My inlaws are convinced lidl wine is good stuff but quite honestly most of it I find undrinkable so when my parents came to dinner also this weekend I decided to up the ante with the wine. Maybe the inlaws would say fair enough, your right, this lidls stuff we have been drinking is crap. Well, this wine is worse. I can't believe how bad this is. The colour is thick, the flavors sickening and the afterburn I can only imagine turps would taste like. I wonder if this is even a real bottle or if these are fake. It's truly disgusting. We still have over a bottle and a half left. At least the prime rib wasn't a let down! Avoid this wine at all costs, I am returning the other one		
uk	Bought on a very strong recommendation from a friend. A good wine to go with a red meat meal, but I have had wines that I enjoyed a lot more for this price.		
uk	"Beautiful bottle of red. Did taste a bit ""tinny"" but having spoken to a wine expert I'm told that 2012 was the vintage year and I probably should have waited before drinking it !!"		
uk	Absolutely Vile. So so disappointed. I tend to go for A Malbec or Durif to give a bit of context. This was sharp and lacked any enjoyable flavour. The finish was rough as hell. To be fair this is a very young wine, perhaps it needed 4-5 years but it didn't taste immature, just unpleasant. All I know is it was horrible & if i'd bought from somewhere with a satisfaction guarantee like Laithwaites, id have complained about it. The 2nd star was because i tried the wine a week later just to see if it had improved and it was almost drinkable. But certainly not worth £5 let alone £15-20.		
uk	The 2014 vintage of his classic South African blend certainly delivers on taste and texture, I've been a fan of this wine from Boekenhoutskloof for many years, it goes extremely well with meat based pizza, wonderful stuff.		
uk	I tried this many years ago and when I saw it on offer I introduced my husband to it. It is lovely and a real treat - but the price means it is a treat and so we try to savour it although it doesn't last v long!		
uk	My all time favourite wine. A must for the wine rack to be saved for a special occasion.....not wealthy enough to drink it on a weekly basis unfortunately.		
uk	Bought this in an Amazon lightning deal at a third off. Still way overpriced. It tastes thin and sharp. I've had better for half of the discount price. It's OK and drinkable - just not a 20 quid plus wine.		
uk	Very good wine for the price. 2014 gave a great vintage. Will definitely be stocking up. Being a young wine it will probably get even better over the next 4-5 years. Highly recommend you try this if you haven't already.		
uk	Bought for my Boyfriend as he went on a trip to south africa and came back raving about this amazing wine. I'm not a red wine lover s to me, personally, it tastes like vinegar but he absolutely loves it and says its his fave wine. He loves it. apparently worth it, if your a lover of red wine		
uk	Really great wine! It is a reasonable price, very drinkable and goes great with richer foods.		
uk	As a wine blogger this is one of those wines you're not meant to like. There's a big fanfare every time the latest vintage is released with retailers overly stating the exclusivity of their minuscule allocation. Bloggers and people in the industry mock the wine as being all style and no substance. Thing is, it does have substance, and a very tasty substance it is too. The wine is layered and complex yet utterly accessible. It's all just a bit tasty really.		
uk	This is possibly one of the best wines I've ever been bought - and subsequently bought again...and again. The characteristic smoky nose of South African reds is lighter, which I prefer and it's packed with juicy berry flavours. I had trouble finding this in the UK a while back so every time I see some, I buy one to top up the store.		
uk	This is the most fabulous wine. We tried this wine whilst on honeymoon in South Africa after a recommendation by a local. Wow it is truly beautiful especially served at room temp or slightly warmed on a cooler day. The complex blend of flavours give a slight hint of chocolate after taste.		
uk	wow! what a wine, first tried it in South Africa now I buy it wherever I find it and it never disappoints		
uk	I love a Shiraz and this one is drinkable, affordable and smooths like my red quite sweet, less bitter, this is perfect for me.		shiraz tai
uk	My favourite Aussie Shiraz at a very good price. Need I say more?		shiraz tai
uk	Simply the best shiraz wine you can get for the right price		shiraz tai
uk	For £5 a bottle this wine is very drinkable, goes down like nothing and tastes good. Was a 8:30pm delivery though so a bit annoying. Other than that fab product.		shiraz
uk	A great quality Shiraz from Jacobs Creek, this is one of a number of sub-£10 a bottle wines we quite often purchase from the supermarket. So why buy from Amazon? Well, it's certainly easier to get it home - delivered well packaged, swiftly to your door ready to stash in the wine rack. However, the real draw has to be the price. To illustrate just how good this can be, at time of purchase our local supermarket was selling this wine for £7 a bottle. The Amazon price, albeit on a Lightning Deal, came in at under £4.40 a bottle for a case of six. This is cheaper than we've seen it on offer anywhere and is about the price you could pay for something pretty nasty indeed. But when you think about it, the price before the Deal was a mere sixty pence more per bottle. So why wait 'til a Deal comes round again? Go on - you deserve it!		shiraz
uk	About the standard you would expect for the price... OK (better after aeration!!)		shiraz
uk	Value for money wine. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.		shiraz
uk	Bought this on offer, £30 for six bottles. Its cheap and cheerful, semi-easy drinking, initial taste is a bit sharp but it grows on you by the second or third glass.		shiraz
uk	This wine at the price I paid was a steal, we love Jacobs Creek red wine.		shiraz
uk	The wine is fine, but the original advertising was`nt.		shiraz
uk	Nice and easy present delivered the next day. Recipient definitely enjoyed and would reorder. Jacobs Creek always tastes nice whatever wine you get and are reasonably priced.		shiraz
uk	We purchased this on the basis of the good reviews. Im sorry but after tasting the first bottle this is reserved for the stew pot only. Its cheap and it tastes it, especially the rough chemically aftertaste. Hadnt drank jacobs creek in years and now i remember why.		shiraz
uk	Really enjoyed this wine so much have bought 4 lots		shiraz
uk	My favourite red, fantastic deal and speedy delivery. Thank you.		shiraz
uk	My friend loves this wine! I don't drink so I can't back that up but I buy it regularly for him.		shiraz
uk	Really not great, cheap price and it tastes it. Its like a wine kit wine		shiraz
uk	A useful way of getting a gift to someone who you won't be seeing over Christmas.		shiraz
uk	Really enjoying the wine. Much smoother than the price would have you expect.		shiraz
uk	Fabulous value for money. Came so quick I was glad I had not paid for next day delivery! Would def recommend.		shiraz
uk	This is not a pretentious wine, and I daresay a connoisseur might be critical. But I find it very acceptable to accompany a meal. And, unless my guests were being kind, they liked it too (judged by the amount they drank!).		shiraz
uk	Received very quickly and well packaged. I normally go for a more expensive wine but thought I'd give it a go. I am impressed by the taste and softness of this one and wouldn't hesitate to buy more in future.		shiraz
uk	One complaint and that is it's advertised as being 14.2% and it's only 13.9%		shiraz
uk	An excellent tasty wine at a great price. I will certainly be buying it again		shiraz
uk	Bought this for my sister for Christmas, and she says it great. I'll take her word for it because I do not drink wine.		shiraz
uk	Great wine for the price. This will my red from now on.		shiraz
uk	What is there not to like about this wine? A great taste and great value for money.		shiraz
uk	Love this wine cheaper than supermarket. Carrier nice xx		shiraz
uk	A nice wine at a good price. Delivered quickly with no hassle. very good.		shiraz
uk	This is an excellent red wine, fruity and not too dry		shiraz
uk	I bought a case from Amazon for £25. This is not the very best Campo Rioja, but at £25 for 6 bottles it can hardly be beat. I use it for mulled wine and it is perfect. I am happy to highly recommend the wine, so long as you can cut a deal on the price.		tempranillo
uk	When you see the pictures you see the wine a 2014 production but if you read the description you realise that this is a 2016, I think this is misleading and misadvertised Not happy		tempranillo
uk	I like Campo Viejo. It's a Rioja with a flavour that I like. I bought 6 bottles for Christmas and I am happy with my choice.		tempranillo
uk	A really nice soft and mellow red. At this price I bought it to cook with, but fortunately it's nice enough to drink so a bottle lasts just the one day!		tempranillo
uk	Very good Riorca wine which I kept buying from my local supermarket at £8.99 a bottle. These bottles priced at £25.02 works out at just over £4 a bottle.		tempranillo
uk	Love this wine and amazing black Friday price... More offers pls		tempranillo
uk	Good quality, tastes great, ace price, what more can you say		tempranillo
uk	A nice wine to have on standby. At the price we paid (<£25 for 6 bottles) its a great deal, and way cheaper than buying it locally.		tempranillo
uk	Goes good with steak and very easy drinking as well. Can't praise this enough.		tempranillo
uk	Arrived well packaged. Only 4 stars because description is inaccurate, this is a 2015 vintage, not the stated 2013		tempranillo
uk	Great tasting wine. Just make sure you let it breathe and warm up.		tempranillo
uk	Great value wine for regular quaffing and always reliable. Great price too		tempranillo
uk	A very nice wine at the right price when discounted as this.		tempranillo
uk	Such great wine,and managed to get it at a great price too!		tempranillo
uk	You may call be a bit boring but I tend to only buy this red wine for drinking at home A - because its an amazing wine that tastes so good , can be drunk with any red meat, cheese or on its own B - because its an amazing wine C - because its an amazing wine and D - because its an amazing wine I may be a bit boring but I'm happy		tempranillo
uk	A great wine and good value. Buying a case of six just in time for Christmas seems like a no brainer. thank you Amazon		tempranillo
uk	Delicious wine! Easy drinking and great with cheese or on its own.		tempranillo
uk	A lovely everyday wine, full bodied and flavoursome		tempranillo
uk	Wine is down to personal preference and this one of my preferences.		tempranillo
uk	Very nice wine, reasonably priced, good to have delivered as a present.		
uk	Bought as part of a Mother's Day gift so both parents could enjoy it. They reported back they loved it! Will definitely purchase again at some point.		
uk	absolutely good value for rioja gran reserva, bought it on primeday		
uk	Definitely one of my budget favourites, sometime you can even snatch it up in a good deal, normal Prime price unfortunately higher than supermarkets but nonetheless - I always keep a bottle or two in my house as it's a perfect wine for anyone!		
uk	Awful. Not sure if it was corked or somethong but it went down the Sink, didn’t even keep it for cooking.		
uk	Delivered on time, well packaged. Beautifully presented and very well received.		
uk	Noticeably better (richer smoother longer) than the cheaper variants		
uk	Slips down a treat! Extraordinarily smooth. I definitely recommend this wine. Our new favourite!		
uk	One of the best wines from Spain. I love ti. Any chance of a free bottle????????		
uk	It clearly describes the Bottle of Wine as a 2010 as i needed one to replace a bottle that i broke that was a gift to my parents from someone, i received a 2011. Surely this is misrepresentation of sale?		
uk	This is an excellent wine. The only issue is price and it may be that with discounts, you can get the same thing for the same or better price at a supermarket. But I would highly recommend the wine.		
uk	Not what i expected, it is a good wine tho, a bit to light in taste, i'll try it tomorow night again		
uk	A product that's nicely packaged and will suit the recipients. Hampers can be very expensive for what you get but this is ideal for Christmas. I'd order this again.		
uk	What a beautiful gift this was. It was delivered promptly, and my daughter described it as classy and well presented. She was delighted with it. The items were of good quality so thank you very much, a good value for money item.		
uk	Was very disappointing, firstly the packaging is not nice! wanted to give it as a birthday present and now i need to repack! Its packed in a ugly red cardboard :( secondly i dont know the price of the rest of the items but the wine cost everywhere around 5 pounds..so the rest is 22?! was expecting nice quality wine, very disappointing!		
uk	Birthday gift for son in law, he thoroughly enjoyed it.		
uk	This hamper is the second I have ordered...it is a delight and nice for any occasion..the company are also a very good company to deal with taking care on delivering too...I will certainly use them again ...thank you Hay hampers ..		
uk	lovely hamper well worth the money will use this company again		
uk	Excellent Value and service from Hays Hampers. Arrived in a timely manner and presented in a professional and well packaged container. Thanks my parents were impressed and I am on the other side of the Atlantic so need to be able to trust suppliers that the product description and customer service is as described.

uk	Sent as a present and well received but can't comment on the contents as I did not sample them as they were 400 miles away!		
uk	I bought this gift set for my future father in-law. This gift arrived on time and was packed great. You get a decent amount of items for the price. You have to make the in-laws happy. As we say in the USA Happy!!! Happy!!! Happy!!! Thank You

uk	The recipient was really pleased with the gift and presentation and I was happy with the service and will use them again		
uk	I was disappointed that the substitute cheese offered was a CRANBERRY wensleydale instead of the cheddar. I would not have minded if the cheese had been a straight forward wensleydale with nothing added. xxx	cranberrythin berry	
uk	Desperately disappointing. I could have bought all the items for under £10 and the packaging was truly horrible - red box filled with polystyrene bubbles that would go all over the place when you hunted for the few mean things inside. I will have to buy a few more things to put into the box as it is embarrassing. It is really not worth even half the money and I will never buy from Hay Hampers again.		
uk	This is great my brother loves this cheese and he lives where he can't get it readily, so when he visits he buys lots in a supplier near me		
uk	Had excellent customer service off of Hay Hampers, with a speedy delivery and a great product. I highly recommend them and look forward to ordering from them again. Stan Collins

uk	Receiver loved the gift but didn't know who it was from. Please include message option		
uk	WE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THESE FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS. THEY WERE PACKAGED BEAUTIFULLY AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE CONTENTS WERE DEVOURED AND ENJOYED ENORMOUSLY		
uk	Quick delivery, packaged well. Opened a bottle already ofcouse and it was delicious. Very happy with the wine and the price for 6. Thank you		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	This wine is rank/awful how anyone can say this is nice. i bought a case after reading all the reviews.poured through aerator and left to stand. the smell not bad but the wine is like vinegar/sour and no its not corked good enough for cooking with but nothing else. pay £3 more and buy 19 crimes or the big red duke and you will smell and taste the difference		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	A very good red wine with a nice flavour so often the tipple of choice in our house. Normally around £6 a bottle through Amazon Prime which is the same price the supermarkets knock it out for on a deal.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Saw this on black Friday being sold on a cracking price. Always loved this wine after first tasting it in v popular Russian Restaurant in Knightsbridge in 2006. Wasn't so well known then so really pleased that I got 3 cases for less than £5 per bottle. Opened one and it tastes great.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	A personal favourite of mine, and at under £5 a bottle you really cant beat it!		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Great tasting wine, our favourite. Fast delivery and a good price		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	well I must say.... cheaper buying here rather than the shops.... my fav tipple.... go on. buy some. very nice...		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Our favourite red wine and bought when on a good deal.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Very happy with this product and I will try this again sometime in the future		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Didn't really enjoy this wine, tasted very acidic. Never again.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Be aware, this is 2016 not 2014 vintage as described		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	superb wine,have been drinking this for over 20 years and it never disappoints,this was a good price.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Vinegary and a bad after taste, won't be ordering again. A screw top no less doubt if a cork would have made a difference.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	A truly delightful wine not using any other Red wine now		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	Great wine. Well packed both in packaging and drinkability. Well recommended.		cabernet sauvignon sauvignon cabernet
uk	This is a pleasant, smooth and easy drinking wine. There is a so called 'sweet spot' prise-wise when buying wine especially from supermarkets or similar. The 'sweet spot' is £10. This wine comes in at under £10 but because it was a case of six I think that the price for a single bottle would be closer to £10. That said this wine at this price is a good purchase and is recommended.		
uk	"Have Bought this wine for over a year now and up until my last delivery, last week it's been fine, a bit fruity and on the sweet side. This batch is not the same. There is the same slightly sweet taste, but no where near as smooth. In fact rather a metallic taste at first. I noticed the award labels have shifted to the other side of the bottle, definitely not the same quality as the previous years. Quite quaffable with food, but a bit ""tinny"" on it's own. Very cheap, so you get what you pay for."		
uk	~ 2013 label ~ McGuigan ~ South Australia ~ 'Black Label' ~ Shiraz, Merlot & Cabernet ~ 13% Vol ~ 750 ml ~ Screw top Over the last few weeks, I have had the chance to sample a variety of the 'McGuigan Black Label' wines. Last Friday night was no exception and the 'McGuigan Black Label ~ Red' was on the menu and it went down very well indeed, especially with a melt in the mouth beef-off-the-rib dish, in my particular case. It had the thumbs up from associates who would normally steer clear of 'a red', although it was a little on the 'jammy' side for a couple of our 'veterans', with the duck in plum sauce. Some took theirs on the lightly chilled side with the chicken-in-a-smoky-barbecue jacket and it was deemed most enjoyable with the pasta & spicy vegetarian dishes, too, not forgetting 'the mini-dessert-pot specials' & the cheese board, which followed. As the evening progressed, each mouthful of this (to me) nicely balanced red suggested a different berry dominance ranging from plum to black fruits...even cherry...with a hint of spice lingering at the finish. And...when the food was all gone...this medium-bodied red was still going down well; what little was left! Impeccably packed for safe transport ~ each bottle in its own box, padded with brown paper, then in a sturdy outer carton.	plum plum cherry spicespicy tar berry jammy light smoky icy	
uk	I am delighted with my recent purchase of a case of McGuigan Black Label Red as it is my favourite red wine. It is even nice to drink on its own which I can not say about many reds as I prefer white wine usually for this purpose. My only complaint is that it doesn’t last very long in our house as it is delicious!!!		
uk	Simply not to my taste. I'd not bought wine from Amazon before but have drunk many bottles of McGuigan over the years. The reviews were good so I thought I'd try this one. It is not like any red wine I've ever tasted. Very much on the sweet side with an odd feeling on the pallet. A friend however enjoyed it. There is no accounting for taste.		
uk	Excellent product, I would certainly consider purchasing this product again. A very light, easy to drink ( actually, too easy to drink !! ) red wine, but watch out for the kick !!		
uk	Nice fruity wine. My wife loves it, shame it’s the only McGuigans wine that doesn’t have offers regularly on amazon. Our best price was 29 pounds for 6 bottles so I've set my camelcamelcamel to let me know when its on offer.		
uk	From what I can recall - very drinkable - Do not drink and drive - this is red wine and it is likely to stain the interior trim and seats if spilt when braking hard.		
uk	This is a very quaffable wine which I tasted on arrival but I was incensed after ordering another case, ONE DAY AFTER MY FIRST ORDER, by clicking on 'buy it again', to be charged an additional £2 per case. I consider this to be extremely dubious practice.		
uk	Sweet. Didn't expect it to be so sweet but the tasting notes clearly mention all the fruits.		
uk	Reasonable quality and a smooth wine but a touch on the sweet side, for me. I think the Malbec is far better – but that’s just a matter of personal taste. Okay to take to a party or maybe for the occasional wine drinker.		
uk	A beautiful wine - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - purchased as a top-up for the wine rack. Anyone who has not tried this wine is really missing out - it is very nice indeed.		
uk	Perfectly drinkable wine, uncomplicated and nice with a pasta or light meat dish. I wouldn't pay over £6 per bottle for this		
uk	My husband tasted this wine this year in Vancouver, and is delighted we were able to buy it on Amazon. He loves it.		
uk	Childminder was very happy to receive this wine at the weekend. She deserves a treat. She said it was a great wine and went down very well.		
uk	Immediately sweet and jammy in the mouth but thick and heavy with no complexity and a bitter aftertaste.		
uk	This is surprisingly good wine, I have to say. I wasn't expecting to like it so much for the price, but it's lovely and soft. I would recommend it without hesitation.		
uk	Cheap and cheerful but makes for easy drinking or glugging g down at a party.		
uk	This has really gone downhill. Used to be lovely, but is now metallic and sugary		
uk	I like this wine, bit sweet but that suits me, pity the price has gone up 50% since I bought the last box.		
uk	Another excellent wine from the McGuigan stable, full bodied and well rounded.		
uk	Lovely wine to drink, it goes down easy, in fact before you know it, the bottle is finished. So easy to enjoy,great flavour from it, have bought this wine several times because we enjoy it and know our friends will enjoy it too..........if we share it with them.		
uk	I have been looking for a light fruity red and this is definitely it! Perfect to drink on its own or with food. Highly recommend.		
uk	My fave. Have ordered twice now and doesn't disappoint		
uk	Nice drop of ted at a well below average price of £28 for six		
uk	This is the second order of Mcguigan's and the vintage of both has been wrong If you are a coniseur beware		
uk	The wine vintage was not as described the year quoted was 2015 a good year and what was delivered was 2016 not such a good year!!		
uk	Bought for my husband for Christmas - fthird lot now - loves it Great price, great quality wine		
uk	We purchased this wine after seeing it on a lightening deal & have enjoyed McGuigan wines before, so thought this would be a safe bet for our Christmas red for the table. This is a very smooth red wine to enjoy, it is not harsh or bitter & everyone commented on how nice a bottle this was. We are not heavy wine drinkers, but this is more than suitable for special occasions. If it comes up again on another deal I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another case.		
uk	Fast delivery, good value wine that is very drinkable. Thanks.		
uk	This is REALLY sweet wine. I don’t think we’re going to be able to drink it. Too sugary.		
uk	Great wine but between the 18th october and the 7th November, its gone up in price by £10. WHY ?		
uk	Nice quality wine would recommend and will buy again		
uk	I first brought this wine on the amazon deal and well it has converted me! I have finally just finished the last bottle and normally I would never spend more than £5 on a bottle (I'm a student so the cheaper the better) but after drinking and enjoying this wine for so long I can now no longer enjoy my old favorites. It comes well packaged and even at normal price I think offers very good value for money. I have completed so many surveys to earn enough vouchers to buy myself and 6 bottles and I can't wait for them to arrive, the flavours of this wine are smooth and strong and even some of my friends and family who are not keen on wine likes this so... It looks like you win McGuigan and have a Students hard earnt money and time that probably should have been spent on studying on this delicious wine!!		
uk	A really nice wine at a very good price.and the fastest delivery I have ever had.Thank you		
uk	Was loved , little bit strong for gift recipient, but he watered it down		
uk	An excellent smooth and very drinkable wine at a sensible price		
uk	Can't get this in the supermarket, but a favourite ! Nice rounded flavour.		
uk	Easy drinking red wine. Bit dear for this type of drink		
uk	Very very nice wine! Always ensure that you up-end the bottle as it's probably been sitting in the Amazon warehouse for a while. This was just as good as ...err some other place I previous purchased from :-) FYI year was 2016.		
uk	This wine is delicious would recommend it to any red wine drinker its yummy		
uk	Absolutely lovely wine - rich, fruity with a lovely mellow aftertaste. I keep stocking up from Amazon as I understand the import of this wine from Australia is coming to an end!		
uk	Be aware that this is a 2016 vintage.. not 2015 as suggested! It's not as smooth as the 2015, more like the black label Shiraz i would say. I am a bit disappointed as not as described..		
uk	Wow if you like a fruity wine then you must try this. It is stunning better than the Merlot and Shiraz though they are both very nice.		
uk	Great value with lightning deal. Very good wine. Will be buying again.		
uk	This is the best red wine ever. I love it. It is smooth and rich and quite sweet. It is also strong. I buy it all thevents time. No other red wine comes close for me.		
uk	Views on taste are highly subjective and I am rather happy to have bought this wine, which tastes far better than anything else I've have tried within its price bracket. Cheers!		
uk	An excellent wine and very good value. Arrived in perfect condition excellent packaging.		
uk	Delicious soft full fruity wine. Great value for this quality. Highly recommended.		
uk	The best red wine I have ever tasted! Can be drunk easily without a meal. Love it!		
uk	One of our favourite wines and enjoyed it very much		
uk	One of my favorite wines, not to sweet , a very easy drinking wine.		
uk	I love this so much, I bought 3 cases! Great price.		
uk	Was looking forward to drinking this but left disappointed. At first it feels quite smooth but has a really overbearing sweetness. Not in a nice way. Less a fruit sweetness and more the flavour of an artificially sweetened drink. A drink that will prove useful when the school is asking for contributions for the summer fete.		
uk	Were excellent at the price I got them (£31). Don't think I'd pay the current price (£42).		
uk	This must be one of the best value reds on the market. Although all the Black Label range are very palatable, the red, which is lighter than the full-bodied Shiraz is particularly easy to drink either on its own or with a range of foods, all year round.		
uk	Better tasting red ever and at a price thats great :)		
uk	Wine delicious but badly packed. Only five bottles received. Please deliver missing bottle.		
uk	Seriously tasty and far too easy to drink. I buy this regularly and would reccomend.		
uk	This is an excellent very drinkable red wine that has impressed my wife and all of our friends. I will order some more soon		
uk	Bought as a 'Christmas Backup' - it arrived perfectly packaged and on time and quality was excellent - will be ordering again		
uk	Sell it for under 30 quid as case and i will then create a subscription - until then it's cost co! Hope readers geddit....		
uk	Very fruity wine. Easy to enjoy with a meal or to relax with in the evenings. It's a versatile and 'anytime' wine. Great.		
uk	If you want a great red wine at a reasonable price McGuigan Black label is the one.		
uk	Lovely wine, £25 for 6 bottles in Asda as of 01/11/2016.		
uk	I bought this not expecting much, but was surprised. Really smooth wine. Very fruity, but not too sweet and very smooth. Would recommend this as an easy drinking wine with pastas and red meats.		
uk	Perhaps one of the best wines I've tasted, smooth, fruity and easy drinking.		
uk	A really lovely red. It is smooth and easy drinking. Not too heavy or to light. Great with all sorts of food or just on its own.		
uk	good value Shiraz at less than 6 pounds a bottle , when you can get it at this price		
uk	This is my favourite wine. Lovely mellow taste strongly recommend it.		
uk	A smooth red and one of our favourites couldnt resist getting a case at that price.		
uk	Absolutely gorgeous red wine. My favorite. Most of our friends who try it get hooked too.		
uk	I first tried this wine in a restaurant and I loved the smooth an fruity taste, been trying to find this wine in the shops but no luck. Thank you		
uk	I love this wine. It is a really nice wine. I wouldn't say it is sweet as someone mentioned here. It has a lovely fruity flavour. I have just bought case of the Merlot to try and it is lovely.		
uk	I am not a wine drinker as I find it generally sour and watery but this red is sweet and fruity and perfect for someone like me. A winebuff would hate it!		
uk	"Very poor, cheap blended ""red"" wine. I got this on an offer, but nothing like the quality of what is sold in the supermarkets for less than it's normal selling price."		
uk	Nice smooth wine with a with a very very slightly sharp-ish dryish undertone		
uk	We came across this blended wine by mistake after trying McGuigan Black label merlot and have not drunk anything else since. The whole family are now hooked as well and Amazon are probably the best place to buy it from as it is not widely available. It is smooth and very drinkable perhaps not to everyones taste but just try it and see!		
uk	I bought this as a birthday present for my husband. It is a lovely wine and he really enjoyed it. It came well packed, very secure, and delivery was very quick. I would certainly recommend this and would buy it again.		
uk	If you like deep, rich, fruity red wine then I can not recommend this wine highly enough. it is so beautifully rich I will have a glass instead of a dessert or reaching for the dark chocolate. The wine I was originally after didn't have an offer on it so I thought I would look around to see what else there was. I am so glad I did, this is my new favourite. We will definitely be keeping a stock of it in the house. I have still to try the other McGuigan wine I had my eye on but was out of stock at the time as it seemed to read better, but I am not sure you can get much better than this one.		
uk	Good price, arrived quickly although not at the time stated		
uk	Just arrived,and one bottle down already.Drank well with dinner.		
uk	Best red wine ever, and such a good price, thank you		
uk	A very easy red, goes with almost everything and on its own.		
uk	A full bodied,tasty and fruity wine that is easy to drink under any circumstance.		
uk	A very smooth palatable wine. One of the best around for the price.		
uk	Bought as a present for my father, they were delivered to his address within two days and he informs me that the wine was excellent.		
uk	This is a very nice wine at the right temperature very moreish. Would certainly buy again.		
uk	A good red wine. I would recommend to friends and family, Smooth and fruity.		
uk	Really excellent wine if you are a fan of Oz wines, puts french wines to shame. Unfortunatlely delivered to wrong house		
uk	Reliable red wine for a good price. Service from this supplier is of a high standard. Recommended		
uk	wife loves this stuff. It costs £7 from Morrisons so at less than £5 a bottle in the Prime Day sale it was irresistible		
uk	Not a bad red.. Black currant and cherry flavours, no tannin aftertaste in all smooth on the palate.. Only criticism is the thin consistency of the wine.. Would buy again! Not bad for the money..	cherrythin smooth	
uk	Very smooth red wine. Of all the wines I've drunk over the years this has got to be my favourite.		
uk	Quick delivery. Recommend if you like a smooth red wine.		
uk	Excellent wine, even if I was sent some Shiraz mixed with the red		
uk	This wine is far too sweet and it's blended, leaving all discerning identity behind. Sadly, all the characteristics of a modern wine from a producer more interested in it's brand than making anything of any real quality.		
uk	This is the only red wine we order by the case. Why drink any thing else when you find the one that stands out from the crowd at such a good price.		
uk	bit dearer than local shops but can not buy in sixes.		
uk	Very happy with this for a cheap wine it is certainly easy to drink. A good aroma and deep dark colour as described and it is in my opinion exactly what it says on the label - Smooth! I am not a wine connoisseur but I know what I like and I have tried many budget wines and this is certainly one of the better ones. Great for parties, or just a relaxing glass or two.		tempranillo
uk	Very very nice wine and great price. Went down very well for a party		tempranillo
uk	I must have got a bad one...It was disgusting and burned my throat. I most certainly would not recommend it.		tempranillo
uk	fairly run-of-the-mill spanish wine, but given the price it was good value for money.		tempranillo
uk	Very easy to drink, doesn't taste cheap and nasty like some do, impressed.		tempranillo
uk	Quite drinkable drop of wine with a nice balance of sweetness and acidity but with lower tannins than a cabernet. This is not unusual since my experience is that low priced Merlot tends to be a lot more drinkable than other grape varieties. The internal packaging is not recyclable but the cardboard is. I suspect that this is offset by the lower environmental impact due to lower weight and less transport costs. I know it's considered sacrilege to chill red wines but not so much for a cheaper one as long as it is robust enough to survive the flavour dampening effect of the lower temperatures and this wine is. If you do put it in the fridge after opening it lasts for a week or two without tasting corked. Very refreshing on a warm summers day when chilled.		merlot
uk	Not bad at all, served at the right temperature there are no tannins on the nose or tongue. Like most budget Merlots it lacks the slightly smokey after taste but it's full bodied and pleasant enough. Good value for money.		merlot
uk	JP Chenet is the top selling brand of French wine and is easily recognised in it's distinctive wide-bodied bottle with the bent neck – a design known affectionately as Josephine. I was lucky enough to purchase this JP Chenet Merlot 2014 Wine 75 cl (Case of 6) as an Amazon Lightning Deal but even at the regular price it works out at around only a fiver a bottle. Unlike most bottles of Chenet – and French wine in general – this variety comes with a screw-top rather than a cork. I generally enjoy Chenet and it is a brand I normally buy when in France, however this 2014 Merlot is not one of the best of their's I've tried although it is reasonable enough for the price. A drinkable Merlot but far from a classic vintage – four stars at the price.		merlot
uk	As always this merlot from JB Chenet is excellent. This is the 2nd batch I have had and will certainly be ordering again when necessary. A truly nice wine.		merlot
uk	Already started drinking. Lovely. I have ordered the low alcohol sparking rose, this dispatch of red, and my next order will be bottles of white. Good quality wines at great prices for the quality.	rosetar rose tart	merlot
uk	A very good Merlot and the price was unbelievably low. I think I got a great deal.		merlot
uk	Excellent Wine, personally I love this. Nice and Fruity, hint of spice. But mellow enough to enjoy on its own.	spicefruity mellow	merlot
uk	Fantastic wine at an even more fantastic price for 6 bottles it is a lovely taste would recommend.		merlot
uk	Order arrived leaking all over our hall carbet! Not happy!		merlot
uk	God its awful. i usually like JP wine but this tastes chemically and watered down. even when put through an aerator and decanted for nearly 2 hours this is rubbish.not even any good for cooking. Amazon were good though and refunded me without question. my other concern is that it has screw tops now..i thought all full sized bottles of jp wines are still corked.		merlot
uk	Bought two cases of this, as it is a very drinkable wine at a reasonable price. I have bought for an upcoming party.		merlot
uk	This wine has been consistently good for a couple of years now - I live in France and always bought it as a favourite - now they have changed the packaging and the wine is not so good - maybe a bad harvest... would not recommend at the moment - I'm on the lookout for a new favourite !!		merlot
uk	Great tasting wine at a bargain price, got them for around £4 a bottle on an Amazon Lightning Deal !		merlot
uk	Glorious, absolutely superb. If you like red wine you will love this. Thank-you Mr Gallo		
uk	Apothic Red bottles have wonderful design. I am proud to have so beautiful bottles on my dinner table. I am sure I will give Apothic as a gift too. I am true red wine lover and Apothic Red has become my favourite wine because its key characteristics. Has a deep, complex, expertly layered flavour. Crafts the finest red blends. Rich Zinfandel, smooth Merlot, flavourful Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon creates layers of dark red fruit complemented by hints of vanilla and mocha. Apothic Red is a very nice fruity wine. I love to drink Apothic Red after a perfect steak at weekends. But it even goes well with savoury snacks after a long and stressful weekday. Apothic is a real enjoyment.	vanillarich smooth fruity vanilla complex	
uk	Stunningly smooth with the right amount of sweetness that makes this wine a joy to drink. I tried this and then had another glass soon after and another bottle soon after that. I had gone off red for a long while but this got my taste buds tingling and has to be my favourite red on the market at the moment.		
uk	This is a lovely fruity and smooth red wine that has converted a couple of my white wine only friends to being red drinkers!		
uk	this is exactly my taste for hot days and salad/ BBQ type meals in the garden. It might be too sweet for some tastes but the fruity flavour is just tast bud exploding pleasurable. Very moorish.		shiraz
uk	Christmas present. Person on the receiving end delighted.		shiraz
uk	Possibly the best rose we have tasted - and we have tasted quite a few !!	roserose	shiraz
uk	I ordered a range of the Echo Falls wine for a girls weekend. They all went and there were no complaints. I wish I could tell you more about the taste but after a cocktail making class, I was an easy sell :)		zinfandel
uk	Cheap wine (in taste and price) wouldn't drink this myself, but great for guests that aren't into quality wine..		zinfandel
uk	This wine has always proved acceptable and welcome by the little old lady to whom presented.		zinfandel
uk	No other rose wine gets a look in since I discovered this Zinfandel - just love the taste, really refreshing	rosefresh rose refreshing	zinfandel
uk	this was for Christmas present told by very ejoyable		zinfandel
uk	Ok but a bit sickly sweet and not the freshest or nicest rose so rated it at 3 stars.	rosefresh tar sweet rose	zinfandel
uk	Gorgeous wine if you have quite a sweet tooth, I love it!!		zinfandel
uk	not the best echo falls but still alright, barefoot is still better by far.		
uk	Oh wow, this is a glorious rosé! Originally got it (at Majestic, sorry Amazon) for the fun fact that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie bought the vineyard and I knew that would be a silly talking point with friends on a summer evening, but boy oh boy, they bought a cracking chateau with superb vineyard and left the team there to keep producing fabulous wines. Amazon now price undercutting Majestic so bought more here this time Its a very light pink, dry, but not lacking flavour (some dry rosés are simply dry/acidic and thats it, the taste is gone 3 seconds later). This has a much longer presence, and whilst I'm not a rosé drinker per se, I would be chuffed to bits to be served this wine at a friends house. Have bought again. Hooked.		
uk	A great example of an upper-echelon Provencal rose, although just a little to sweet to be mentioned alongside the very best. If you can pick it up around £10 per bottle then definitely go for it, but anything above that price and I'm afraid it doesn't match the likes of Chateau De Berne (sold in majestic at £12 to £14 a bottle). I suspect some of the 5-star reviews are a reflection of the celebrity influence which, whilst understandable, is not actually a fair and objective reflection upon the quality of the wine itself. It is very good, significantly above average - but it's by no means the best rose Provence has to offer. Don't take my word for it - do your research and see what the French themselves buy.	rose rosethin tar sweet round rose	
uk	Purely bought just to be able to say I tried it, but now I can say I tried it and I liked it. Yummy wine and I drank it all myself in one sitting. I managed to wait til people had left before cracking this open and I'm glad I did as it was delicious.		
uk	Excellent wine but grossly over-packaged and over-priced. Same wine from other suppliers is more convenient and cheaper		
uk	Delicious, light, sophisticated evolving flavour. If you like pale Rose you can't go wrong here and you certainly won't find anything that tastes like this for a fiver like the other commenter suggested. If you can please tell me what it is!	rosethin light rose	
uk	I was introduced to this gorgeous wine by some friends, and basically have never looked back!		
uk	Fabulous wine, is now my favourite. A beautiful Rose.	roserose	
uk	We love this Rose, it is just delightful,please try it you will not be disappointed I promise you.	roselight rose	
uk	Bought this purely for my love of Angelina Jolie. Haven't drank rose in a while as I'm more a fan of white now but this was amazing. Would highly recommend.	roserose	
uk	My favourite rose ever, light, fresh, perfect drink on a hot sunny day.	rosefresh light hot rose	
uk	Miraval Rose was a disappointment for me. I found it lacking the delicacy or freshness that usually marks a good provencal rose.	rose rosefresh rose	
uk	This is my all time favourite beautiful every day Rose. You just can't get any better. Really wonderful...😍	roserose	
uk	Beautiful summer drinking , so much flavour will absolutely buy more.		
uk	Disappointing compared to other Provence rosés, not really worth the price compared to other bottles at similar value.		
uk	this is an amazing rose wine me and my husband just love it.	roserose	
uk	Nice fruity Rose. Not only nice because this is Angelina Joli and Brad Pitt's wine, the taste is genuinely nice. Good value for money when bough under a deal. Serve very fresh!	rosefresh fruity rose	
uk	Creamy Rose. Gave me a hangover. Had better for a lot less in my opinion.	rosecreamy rose	
uk	I will hold my hands up and say that the main reason I bought this is because I am a huge Brad and Angelina fan. However, if you read up on professional wine taster reviews you will see that this was voted the best Rose wine in the world! The bottle is simply beautiful, and the wine itself is a lovely pale pink colour and quite a delicate taste. You can literally taste the quality, and I for one will happily pay the price when the taste is this good.	rosedelicate rose	
uk	Very drinkable and smooth but not much else too it. Way over priced. Would expect this sort of quality in a regular £5 bottle.		
uk	Nice wine, wouldn't pay full price. Glad I got it in deals.		
uk	Smelt lovely, smooth to drink but tasted awful. Left almost a peppery after taste.		
uk	Looking at the packaging, this is basically a champagne bottle—which is a little bit odd. I think the feeling is that with rosé, you have to distinguish yourself. I think the packaging with this wine is so out of the realm of what you would expect [for rosé] that it makes you more skeptical of the quality than you might otherwise be. The Miraval Côtes De Provence seduced already with its bright, salmon-colored pink. The fantastic bouquet presents delicate aromas bright fruits, freshly picked strawberries and flowers. Palate impress complexity, notes of wild raspberries and strawberries, wild herbs, citrus and reminiscent of wet rock nuances. The refreshing acidity is due to the higher altitude vineyards. The final design is round, long-lasting and vibrant. Enjoy with friends.	citrusfresh citrus thin delicate round bright raw refreshing complex	
uk	Always a very consistent taste. Light and refreshing without food but can accompany any dish. Delivered on time, every time.		zinfandel
uk	Love this wine good deal and I could fill the wine rack doesn't last long though as i keep drinking it 😜		zinfandel
uk	Good wine and reasonably priced Will be ordering more later		zinfandel
uk	This is a present for my sister who loves this Echo Falls wine it is her favorite drink!! Good price for 6 bottles!! someone will be happy over the festive season!!!		zinfandel
uk	I got these for the kids for when we have champagne. They're much drier than ordinary grape juice, and while they're not as dry as a dry champagne they're certainly a long way from drinking juice. Very nice.		
uk	Bought this for dry Jan for when with friends who are drinking. Tried it today and like most others it is very sweet. If you like dry wine I would not recommend this more like a sweet jammy wine		
uk	This is really really sweet and in my opinion very similar to shloer (except shloer is a lot cheaper and to my mind tastes better)		
uk	fast payment , fast transaction , fast delivery , top quality product recommended to everyone A++++++++++		
uk	Love this as I feel like I'm celebrating everytime I open a bottle.		
uk	Smooth with well balanced flavours. A classic party tipple.		shiraz
uk	Jacobs Creek Classic Shiraz Rose 75 cl is one very nice fruity tasting wine which I would happily recommend. The taste of the strawberries does come through which I do believe is the main reason I do like it so much. The only problem I have with it, I drink it like lemonade which is rather sore on the head the next morning. Happy to recommend.	rosefruity raw rose	shiraz
uk	Wine o wine o wine, its wine with a great body and plenty of curves!!		shiraz
uk	"Don't be put off by the fact that this is a ""British Wine"" (i.e. made from imported grape juice) - It's the taste that matters, and this is a most delightful rosé with subtle strawberry notes, making it enjoyable to drink both with or without food. Best served straight from the fridge, it has a screw top if you fancy keeping some back for the following evening."	strawberryberry light raw	rosé
uk	I ordered a range of the Echo Falls wine for a girls weekend. They all went and there were no complaints. I wish I could tell you more about the taste but after a cocktail making class, I was an easy sell :)		
uk	Very sweet, almost like an alco pop. All down to personal taste.		
uk	I loved being able to make a 'Revision Hamper' up to send to my daughter in university who was under pressure with revising all week.... one of many nibbles added to her box to keep her going. A nice surprise and stuff she would not even think of buying herself. Thank you Amazon Pantry x		
uk	Given as a present and liked very much by the recipient		
uk	I'm not keen on this. It doesn't advise what berries are in it so there may be one that I don't like		
uk	Very sweet, like it says on the bottle get ginger beer or make a spritzer with soda.	gingersweet	
uk	As we are temporarily house-bound I ordered this for my wife - who HATED IT - and I can't blame her. Unbelievably SWEET, and only 9% proof as well. This is a blended wine of unknown country of origin. I have mixed it with cheap red wine to use purely for cooking - and as there are six bottles it will last a long time		
uk	Great taste will be buying from this seller again Thanks		
uk	First time I tried this Summer Berries Echo Falls it tasted first class will be buying more, 100%.		
uk	really sweet bought it for my boyfriend on his birthday went down the sink!		
uk	Nice refreshing drink nice fruity taste currently a favourite of mine		
uk	Wine was fine but on the dry side hoped it would be medium like a gallo,		
uk	Wine was really good for the price, would go really good with deserts due to the rosey taste.		
uk	Fantastic wine you don't get that vinigary taste at all unlike some other wine's. Great price too I drank a bottle to test and the other two bottles are a gift.		
uk	So glad to find out that I can buy this in the UK. It is a lovely summerry rose very popular in South Africa. Probably my favourite wine.	roserose	
uk	love this wine and cant purchase in shops will be having some more soon		
uk	I love this wine, unfortunately it is always unavailable!!

uk	Actually had 6 bottles of red delivered instead of 6 bottles of rose, my wife was NOT impressed this morning!!	roserose	rosé
uk	A good value medium rose, just too sweet for my palate but my wife loves it.	rosesweet rose	rosé
uk	This has lovely soft-fruit flavours but is a little too sweet for my taste. There’s nothing on the label or in the Amazon description to say, but I’d rate it medium-dry or even medium. Neither are we told what grapes are used but apparently it’s a blend of shiraz, cabernet and merlot. I couldn’t detect the shiraz – the wine is very soft and creamy, with no obvious spiciness. With just the lightest sparkle, it works well as an aperitif and would be lovely outside on a warm summer’s day. I wouldn’t serve it with food except desserts or, perhaps, light, fruity main courses. But that’s just me – I don’t normally go for rosé wines. If you’re a fan, you’ll probably thoroughly enjoy this and then it would make a good buy.		rosé

uk	This is such a lovely wine; the flavour is dry but isn't harsh - I'd recommend this to people who don't normally like rosé if that makes sense! I find that a lot of rosé is too sweet or has an overly acidic aftertaste, this has a nice clean finish similar to a medium-dry white.		
uk	Considering all the possative Wright up,it was just lacking in substance		
uk	Brought to my attention by a friend who raved about it... turns out they'd only bought it because David Beckham had mentioned it on twitter! As Provencal rose goes it's above average, but does not justify the £16 per bottle price. I would buy it again if I could find it around £10 per bottle but it's a touch too heavy and sweet for my taste to go any further than that. If you like a dry, crisp rose then you might want to look elsewhere, perhaps Chateau Font Du Broc or Chateau De Berne, and pay a little less for a better wine. It's by no means bad, but it's sweeter and heavier than you'd expect for a top-tier Provencal rose so I can't give it the fifth and final star.	rose rose roseheavy tar crisp sweet dry round rose	
uk	A good Rose.... very fashionable this summer but still not quite as good as Miraval. I'm being fussy but there is a slight acidity to the taste.... but compared to the average Rose, this is still an A lister....	rose roselight rose	
uk	This is a proper Rose, hard to find in supermarkets. It has a clean crisp taste that doesn't overpower like most Rose wines do.	rose rosecrisp lean clean rose	
uk	I'll admit that I bought this bottle of rosé as it was spoken about on a podcast I listen too. I'm not always a fan of rosé as I can find it too sweet but this was lovely and dry with a nice taste. I used it to help drown someone's sorrows and I kind of wish I'd kept it to drink all by my self as it was so delicious!!		
uk	Great wine and would highly recommend. Very well protected!		
uk	Its OK a bit bitter - I will stick to Chateau Leoube for my summer wine.		
uk	First experience of this wine independent of the Ivy Restaurant love it & strongly recommend a bottle!		
uk	on a sunny summer day, , as aperitif or with a pizza, or mediteraneen dishes, or picnic? with moderation, but great dry roséwine. Pity so expensive, so was great to find it at reduced price from amazon. Just for a day though!		
uk	Was amazed to find this for sale on Amazon. I was slightly suspicious so only bought 4 bottles...but yes its the real thing and it so utterly delicious! Perfect for a summer drink!		
uk	wife loves it and it all got there well packed and quickk!

uk	I love the bottle. very cute bottle. Looks good for gifts. I recommend it if you drink alcohol.		
uk	My favourite at an excellent price also. I should have ordered more!		
uk	Great light wine to drink with salads or a good sea food.		
uk	A beautiful delicate wine soft on the palette for the lighter taste in wines		
uk	This wine is very easy to drink and goes with most things. It doesn't seem that readily available so we we buy it whenever we see it at a good price. Beware :- I ordered some more in May 2017 and instead of packs if 3 bottles I received part of my order in the form of single bottles that were incorrectly marked up as packs of 3. Amazon have graciously rectified the issue.		sauvignon blanc sauvignon

uk	Fabulous wine for this red hot summer we are having !!!! Try It !!! Buy a crate ,I will be back !!!		
uk	Arrived a bit late due to first lot damaged. A very tasty wine, much more strawberry flavoured than the one at The Blue Lagoon due to the strawberry fruit in it. I highly recommended it.	strawberry strawberryberry aged raw	
uk	This is a fantastic sparkling wine, perfect for long lazy days in the garden, reading a book and watching the sun go down. Just wish it was available in a shop so I didnt have to pay so much for postage and packaging!		
uk	Tastes amazing! Everyone loved it despite having different tastes in wine.		
uk	Great prosecco. Really creamy and tasty. Tried it whilst touring Italy. Great to find it online now I'm back		prosecco
uk	A really great tasting prosecco. Very refreshing. The bottle is beautifully designed too.		prosecco
uk	This is my favourite wine. I bought 15 bottles for my wedding toast. Good price £6.50 only downside is 5 per customer not address ;-) very fast delivery		
uk	Quite a nice and very sweet bit of fizz. Perfect for those that don't like brut sparkling wines.		
uk	Great wine that leaves Prosecco in the starting block .		
uk	Bottle doesn't look like this. I thought I was paying for a nice differently decorated version i.e. a limited edition. I ended up with a normal bottle that I could of got £2 cheaper from Tesco! Rip off!		
uk	You can keep your expensive French fizz, I prefer the Muscat grape and this is with out doubt the best of the Asti's.		
uk	Alcohol is a wonderful thing! Even better when it taste nice! Who doesn't like Asti		
uk	Excellent customer service. Received the next day .Asti perfect .Thank you . Highly recommended!		
uk	Very nice stuff, got it at £6.00 for a bottle. Nice boxing day meal time tipple.		
uk	I bought this for a birthday present for a friend and she loves it.		
uk	bought this because it was £2 cheaper than in the major supermarkets,goes with any food you like and will buy again		
uk	My fav sparking drink, what can i say, im a cheap date! Lol		
uk	Everyone has different tastes... however, I cannot believe the ratings this has been given. I felt physically sick drinking this 'sparkling wine'. After three sips, my guests and I, emptied the rest of the bottle into the sink. I'm sure this speaks volumes. Shame, as I had high hopes.		
uk	bought it before xmas for a sixer. one of our favorites, wish I had ordered more for a reasonable price when discounted. easy drinking, medium to sweet fizzy.		
uk	Was looking for a sweet wine and this did the trick. Definitely will be sticking with this one.		
uk	My favorite drink. Good package and good price. Thank you		
uk	Love Martini Asti, great with chambord. Good price on Amazon.		
uk	excellent product my favourite wine and very good price very pleased indeed		
uk	I'm sorry I can only give 4 stars as the service is great, my order arriving 3 days before predicted. The problem I have is that the item is advertised as being in an elegant gift box which to be fair it is, however the bottle doesn't fit the box it's which is too small so you can't close the lid. As this is a 50th birthday present I am somewhat disappointed.		
uk	The is by far the most elegant champagne I have drank.		
uk	Great delivery and no other problems despite the fact it’s advertised with a box so I assumed that’s what it be presented in however this is not the case nor was it indicated to say if you wanted it to come in the branded box therefore my reason for given one short of a star.		
uk	I received vodka!!!!! However I still want my champagne please!		
uk	Bit on the expensive side but superb quality and great for special occasions.		
uk	This was ordered for my son's wedding which isn't until September, so not yet been opened. Since it has five stars from everyone, I'm expecting it to be fantastic.		
uk	Can't fault the wine! The bottle is very impressive, the packaging is impressive and the taste is equally as impressive. Amazing gift for anyone!		
uk	Bought this to wet the baby's head. Not a champers drinker but special occasion and all that. I drank this in the garden with a friend on a sunny day to kick things off. Very sweet but I enjoyed it and will most likely buy it again should an occasion arise fit for it.		
uk	Placed order paid it was delivered on the day they said and it was Christmas Excellent IMO		
uk	I have bought it for our little staff party to share with our manager and everyone was surprised with the taste of it- it was goooood ! Not for sweet champagne lovers though, but very light and fresh in flavour. I'm not an expert on champagne but this one stands out !		
uk	This is without doubt a fantastic champagne. I originally purchased one in the late 1990's when I was privaledged to visit the Ruinart House. I loved the rounded taste, gorgeous fruits, well balanced acidity and yeastyness with typical chardonnay fruits, melon, apples, peaches. Some said they tasted other fruits. But that's OK taste is individual and our taste buds work by association. they highlight flavoures we recognise. If you have never tasted rip juicy apples hoe do you compare. I was lucky to visit with a comapny I worked for at the time and was impressed with all their champagnes. They provided a tasting of their range and while the vintage Rose was my favourite, the 1990 vintage we tried was heaven the Blanc de Blanc was so well balances with a perfect levels of acidity, fruit and a biscuity edge I purchased one. When I win the lottery I will buy both by the case. I recently purchased one for Christmas day, so I am looking forward to becoming aquainted with another bottle. thought I would make the effort in case I am made redundant in the new year. The one I purchased comes with a tasting set. The box opens up and aswell as a bottle of Ruinart nectar it has a number of small vials that contain aroma's assosiated with the wine and a small game based on this. Ruinart is one of the finest champagne houses in France. I would be surprised if anyone tried it and did not like it. If you get the oportunity try some, treat yourself, we all deserve one, we work hard to earn a crust.	rosejuicy tar apple light yeasty round biscuit icy rose melon	
uk	A really lovely soft champagne. It's light and subtle flavours are wonderful. Miles better than your standard Verve or Moet, but then again it should be for the price! Can't afford it all the time, but as a treat every now and then it's worth paying for.		
uk	My favourite for a chilled night in with my husband. A delicious fruity taste to drink alongside meat or fish and get mellow. I review all items I buy on amazon, irrespective of price as I myself have found reviews help to make the right decision when shopping. I hope you have found this review helpful.		
uk	We have this wine every Sunday with our Sunday lunch		
uk	We love this fruity wine on our house. Its so drinkable the contents disappear fast.		
uk	This is a lovely drink very light on the tongue, could use this for any occasion, I liked it so much that ive now had 5 bottles because my daughter liked it too, the taste is zingy and fresh and its a great price and I will be ordering more, I would recommend to family and friends, im so pleased with this, thanks.		
uk	Very sweet and not very effervescent - found it slightly sickly, and the flavour and consistency deteriorated quickly after opening.		
uk	Bit of a cheap wine, but fruity. Perfect for guests at large parties that aren't too fussy.

uk	My partner of some 27 years has recently retired and as I knew that I would be presenting his retirement 'do' I prepared a powerpoint of some interesting and varied photos from his (and my) years in medicine. I knew that my new partner would also be at this event and I was very keen to mark her arrival as something significant and important. As soon as formalities were drawing to a close, I managed a few more words by way of welcome, and this excellent bottle underscored this beautifully. I deliberated for a little while as to whether the bright pink box and similarly adorned bottle, was the correct approach, but decided ultimately that for the bright intelligent young woman that she is - it was just about perfect. All in all for marking an occasion, a crucial appointment and the arrival of a special person, I could not have chosen more wisely.		rosé
uk	An excellent all round Champagne and a beautiful Rosé which gives it that extra touch when presented as a present. Tastes and looks good, just what you want.		rosé
uk	Fantastic seller VERY VERY impressed with the way the champagne arrived! It couldn't be damaged or broken as it was in it's own self contained pack. Brilliant!! Would def use seller again		rosé
uk	Product didn't come with a nice box shown in pics and the gift tag wasn't a gift tag, my message was written on scrap paper & was nothing like the smart ones I've got before. I will have to wrap and tag myself then.		rosé

uk	Moet is an entry level champagne which offers exquisite value for money. The rose expression is delicious & at the price being offered here, definitely worth considering in place of some similarly priced Brut champagnes. It really is the perfect way to cap off any celebration & has become the choice of tipple for Christmas day in our household.	roserose	rosé
uk	As everyone knows, you can't go wrong with Taitti for a nice bottle of bubbles. However, this was bought in a small batch of 6 individual bottles for different recipients as gifts, each with gift messages which none of the recipients found inside so were unaware of who sent them. I was due to buy several more batches from Amazon, but I'm afraid I'll now be buying them elsewhere. For a regular customer, I'm very disappointed!		tai

uk	Please be aware that this rose Champagne does not come with the gift box as advertised, it came in bubble wrap. As this was a gift we were very disappointed. Although Fine Wine cellars did try to compensate and provided quick responses to my complaint it did not really help us. We had wanted to give the boxed Rose along with a standard bottle of Veuve Clicquot, which we already had. Thus, the intention had been, a lovely gift of 2 bottles of boxed champagne. My point is, we didn't receive what was advertised and what we thought we'd paid for!	rose roseplain rose	rosé

uk	overall happy this is always going to be a lovely bottle of bubbly but unfortunately i cant see the one they send me and by the looks of it neither do they! damaged box makes it almost not a nice champagne as i will be embarrassed to get it out on a special occasion as it not a cheap bottle! my advice, go get it from a shop as choose which one you want,		
uk	Very, very disappointed. Box arrived in tatters (surprised the bottle was still in one piece!), looked as though it had been given to a family of raccoons to nest in before it arrived to its destination, no excuse.		
uk	Box came crushed even though it was protected in plastic casing.		
uk	My husband and I were given a bottle of this for an anniversary present, so I bought one for a friend's 70th Birthday. It is a super size, large enough for a celebratory 'pop of the cork' and plenty to go round a group of guests. Looks good and tastes rather yummy too!		
uk	"I thought I had ordered a ""boxed"" bottle of Champagne and was extremely disappointed when it was just a plain bottle, no box. This was ordered as a gift and the description is very misleading and I am not stuck with a bottle of champagne that is no use to me."		
uk	Price is getting too high every half a year. Bought first one for 22pounds in 2016. Look how much it costs now.		
uk	What can I say perect gift, nice box, recipient pleased every time.		
uk	This was ordered as a 50th birthday present for a friend who is partial to a drop of champagne. it was boxed up lovely giving it an extra special touch which also made it easier to wrap, even if I had to cobble together two odd bits of wrapping paper that my two year olds had picked out. Luckily the recipient appreciated the 'mummy really forgot to go and buy special wrapping paper' look. He assured me it tasted great and I've no reason to doubt the fellow!		
uk	The bottle did not arrive in the presentation box which meant I had to buy a gift bag separately detracting from the original gift		
uk	Bought this as a wedding present but not impressed with the appearance on arrival. Top of box has ugly creases and foil over top of cork is slighly worn/damaged so looks second hand.		
uk	excellent product and quick service and good price too		
uk	Great value product. Really quick delivery, the champagne was delivered the next day, just in time for our celebration! It came in a lovely box just like you would get in the supermarket or department store. Why pay more?! Would highly recommend and would use again.		
uk	Good delivery but it's a shame you can't send a short message with it .. the recipient had to guess who it was from .. !!!!		
uk	Personally, I don't see the point of paying this kind of money for fizzy grape juice that happens to come from a certain part of the world. For me, a bulk buy of Buds from Morrisons is more to my taste plus you don't need to clean up an awkward glass that you can't put in the dishwasher after. However the wife likes it so happy to down the bottle after the sociable sample that I have.		
uk	no comment ,after 3 emails, no news ,no shipping informations ,delay . No good....		
uk	Excellent simply the best and most drinkable champagne we have ever had at anything like this price, enjoy.		
uk	Nice champagne and a good offer price but the postage is dear.		
uk	Ideal value for money love the bag its a wee chiller		
uk	You cannot beat Moet. Arrived safely and the two bottles were very well packaged.		
uk	Arrived in good condition and as expected. Box looks very smart - great to give as a gift.		
uk	This is so great good exlent for the price, i always pay £40 in shops, paid £25 great to give as gifts at that price on my 2nd bottle will be ordering 3rd soon please stay at that price'		
uk	Most people accept the taste of it. 25 pounds for a bottle of champagne with gift packaging. Stock it up for any occasion or simply drink it for no reason.		
uk	The champagne was great !! Once again congratulations to Amazon for offering a very good price for a premium product AND have it delivered directly as requested the very next day !! Who can match that service ??? Nobody. Keep up the great work !! Bob		
uk	what can I say. It's good champagne at a very good price.		
uk	Perfect as always, the little gift bag makes that gift just a little bit more special.		
uk	When wrapping a bottle housed in a nice card presentation box it's always best not to compress the whole thing in an inflatable bottle protector. It does rather crush the box and spoil things somewhat. That bubble wrap is fine on a solid firm bottle, but not on a card box.		
uk	Assume the champagne, which I bought as a present, was up to its usual high standard.		
uk	Come on who doesn't like Champagne if you buy it. Arrived very well packed, shelf life I can't comment on drunk it the day it arrived :)		
uk	Disappointed with how long it took to even be dispatched. Received after event. And label on top of cork scratched expected more however am sure the content is fabulous		
uk	It arrived in good time, as I'd hoped; and, although it was bought as a present for friends, I did get an enjoyable taste in the end.		
uk	prompt delivery was ver4y very happy with the product thank you		
uk	Bought this as Christmas gifts for my friend, he absolutely loved it and keeps talking since last Christmas.		
uk	I bought this for my brother's birthday as I couldn't be there. Apparently it went down a treat and was very much appreciated - so thanks very much for your service.		
uk	Bought for my brother's birthday and he was delighted		
uk	It is exactly what's pictured, and it was fast delivery.		
uk	Sent as a gift. Great Champagne and nice presentation box. Securely packaged in the usual Amazon fashion so arrived safely.		
uk	Thank you for your quick delivery. Came with everything as described. Will be buying again		
uk	Came in time. exactly as decribed. V greatful recipient.		
uk	A presentable bottle from a well known Champagne house plus, if you have Prime, delivered the next day at no extra cost. Taste wise it's nice too and not too dry or fizzy with a strong fruitiness - unless you are a champagne expert and can afford to spend a significant amount more this represents a good balance between cost/taste. In my experience a very well presented and received gift.		
uk	Very elegant looking bottle and comes in the presentation box. Was a nice gift to give and will be consumed very quickly		
uk	Briliant! I just can't wait to enjoy it with my girl! Thanks!		
uk	Came gift boxed and then outer boxed and then amazon boxed. So really securely packed. And next day too! Nothing negative to say. It's a standard champagne for the average occasion. Price was a bit below average which is always nice.		
uk	The standard champagne for parties and gifts where the recipient is not a Champagne Buff. The label is widely recognised and the wine easy to drink and enjoy. Not what I buy for my own consumption but appreciated by most people.		
uk	It's always great to collect top bottles of champers when they are around £20-£25 each. Any excuse to drink on little victories in life. Next event is the return of my R6 after waiting for nearly 12 months, sodding insurance companies.		
uk	Absolute bargain! Bought as a hen do gift and was very well received!		
uk	Great gift but no gift message left with it. Luckily I emailed her before as she wouldn't have know who sent it otherwise.		
uk	Who wouldn't love Moet at such a good price. Bought for an upcoming wedding celebration.		
uk	this was supposed to be gift wrapped and message happy 21st birthday shannon included.very dissappointed opened last minute before going to take present did not have time left to get gift wrapping paper and card.so COULD NOT GIVE IT TO THE 21ST BIRTHDAY GIRL SHANNON.SHOULD NOT SAY GIFT WRAPPED AND MESSAGE WHEN DO NOT DO IT.		
uk	The champagne was for a friend's 50th birthday celebration. It got there on time and he enjoyed it very much. I couldn't go wrong with a Moet and Chandon champagne. Glad to have the Amazon UK to send our Welsh friends gifts. Great variety.		
uk	One word...Perfect!!! Was anniversary gift for my parents and they loved it!!		
uk	Product was great. However, Amazon dumped it on my doorstep with no gift card, recording that it had beed 'delivered to a receptionist'. When I complained to Amazon, I got no response. Could easily have been stolen before I got home. Won't be buying product again.		
uk	I'm not a conaseur, but this takes like fizzy cat pee. I was trying to impress, and it had the desired effect. The bottle and box look the business, but champagne is for pretenuos yuppys, and I won't be bothering again.		
uk	Timely delivery and great brand. I didn't get the gift cards as requested with them		
uk	Amazing.. Also the gift wrap from Amazon was completely beautiful! Thank you Amazon for another great item		
uk	Do not order this if you are expecting it to be gift boxed. It came in a generic brown cardboard box, NOT the fancy one in the picture! Rip-off!!!!!		
uk	Great buy, bought for my son sitting his driving test tomorrow, so hopefully have it opened then.		
uk	lovely ,exactly what was required ,nice 60th birthday present at a nice price		
uk	What's not to like with this tried and tested favourite		
uk	Champagne as you would expect. Just as easy to pick up on a weekly shop though so given price is around the same and not cheaper; loses one star		
uk	Beautiful gift!!! Lovely box, delivered as seen on the photo and came extremely quickly with amazon prime! Highly recommend. My friend is chuffed!		
uk	Great value for this lovely occasion fizz But mainly want to say a huge thankyou to the courier, who went above and beyond, calling THREE TIMES on consecutive days, to ensure delivery Massively aporeciated 👍		
uk	Another great bottle of champagne on a lightning deal. Well worth the asking price, even more so if you are lucky enough to get it at deal time		
uk	Got it at a very good price for Xmas was money well spent		
uk	Lovely stuff, superb price. Wish I had been able to purchase more now! Thanks for the swift delivery!		
uk	fast delivery this was for my friends 40th great value		
uk	Decent champagne at a decent price. Postage and packaging, no issues so all good		
uk	I ordered this in time for Christmas. It came pretty quick too. Always good to treat yourself to a bottle of Moët, especially if it's at a great price 😊		
uk	Nice champagne as normal. Great service from the supplier.		
uk	Bubbles always a good thing ! Arrived on time no issues !		
uk	What can I say, great price on a deal of the day and always a lovely treat		
uk	Real shame that the bottle I received was corked as it was for a special occasion.		
uk	This is meant to be gift boxed and it arrived just the bottle. It was meant as a gift. Not happy		
uk	Love my Moët and love a bargain price. Was delivered next day, well wrapped.		
uk	Not overwhelmed by this champagne. Had nicer cheaper ones and proseccos.		
uk	One of my favourites behind Dom Perignon, but nearly a 1/4 of the price though.		
uk	Was a gift, always a great champagne for celebrations		
uk	Great value and arrived super quick - well in time for Christmas celebrations		
uk	Great value and love the presentation box it comes in		
uk	Bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it		
uk	Good price delivered on time wonderful present to my family only problem no gift card		
uk	Super champagne at super price! A great Valentine's gift		
uk	What can be said? It's what it says on the bottle ... champaign. Always recommended, especially when it's priced well.		
uk	I love love love the champagne, which is why I chose it for a gift. However, I am not impressed by the fact that I sent it as a birthday gift (ticked the right part, and wrote a message for my friend when ordering) but none of that was with the delivery. Not quite what I'd planned for a friend on a special occasion. She had to post a pic on social media to ask who had sent it!		
uk	It's Lanson, I love it always, and this time was no different. Fresh, complex for a non vintage and bubbly. Arrived quickly, safely and well packaged.		
uk	Sent to my sister in the UK for her birthday, she loved it!		
uk	Good price and nice box, unfortunately inside had been ripped so had to sellotape it.		
uk	Its Lanson champagne, at a decent price! Nothing more to say		
uk	Excellent product and good value for money! Will buy the same product again in the not too distant future. Tastes good too!		
uk	Whilst the external packaging was excellent, when opened the actual presentation box housing the bottle was badly dented and squashed!! Extremely disappointed, this is a birthday gift and I will now have to go out and purchase a presentation box!		
uk	Timely delivery nice dry champagne exactly as described		
uk	Unlike depicted, the bottle didn't come in a box, but with a union jack sleeve, which was disappointing - especially since it was supposed to be part of a wedding gift! If known it wasn't in the box, I wouldn't have ordered it.		
uk	This sparkling wine was included [as one of 4 reference champagnes] in the annual blind tasting of English sparkling wines in March 2012 ['Judgement of Parsons Green' competition]. It came in 88th out of the 90 wines entered. In other words there were 84 English sparklers that were better than this - and most of them cost less. The sparklers on sale at [...] came in at 85 and 89 [pink] and are therefore comparable in quality but are somewhat better value!		
uk	No wonder is one of the oldest producer in the world. You simply can't beat the price for the quality you get. I'm very picky when it comes to champagne but I love this one. Nice flavoured and not too dry. I'd drink this over moet or veuve any time. If you don't want to break the bank this is perfect for any occasion.		
uk	One can never fail with Lanson Black Label. The price was good and delivery excellent,		
uk	This is a most agreeable Champagne, it is consistently good and this was at a very fair price.		
uk	Very disappointed as advertised as complete with gift box and came without the box!! So could/should have just purchased at local supermarket		
uk	Was delivered very quickly, tasted great, had a special feel, so perfect for the drink for countdown to the New Year!		
uk	Great champagne and very quick delivery from seller. Great as a present. However, does not arrive with gift box. Would recommend.		
uk	Brought as a Christmas gift so unable to comment on quality but very reasonably priced		
uk	Totally delicious champagne so you can gift it with confidence (and the box makes it extra special)		
uk	Fantastic purchase, lovely to drink. Superbly packaged and arrived on time. Great purchase.		
uk	Not too sure it's the genuine article, ordered some from Sainsburys to compare. Seems rather flat, not too many bubbles.		
uk	Bought this from NZ to send as a gift to a friend in England. She was very happy but it would have been great if there had been an option to put a note or gift card with it		
uk	Did not come gift box like it has stated on the website		
uk	I sent the champagne to my family for Christmas. I live in the USA so it was a perfect way to celebrate across the miles. My family really enjoyed the champagne, appreciated the quality. They were delighted. Presentation and quality!		
uk	I love this Champagne - it isn't too sweet or too bubbly so we served it to our guests at our after wedding party and they were all interested to know what brand it was. The price on Amazon is really great value so go ahead and try it.		
uk	My wife's all time fav and we pick it up when we can but not from Tesco, who are still flogging their Christmas stock.....still in its Santa Jackets too........ So I brought two bottles, one for Mother's Day and one for my wife's birthday in April.......Am I happy? YES!!!!!		
uk	I chose this rating because in all the years I've enjoyed a glass or two of this delightful champagne I've never been able to fault it. It is simply one of the nicest & I can highly recommend it.		
uk	I'm sure the person who received this as a gift will enjoy the bottle but it was ordered as a Christmas present and only arrived on 9th January.		
uk	Very pleased with the champagne I sent as a present		
uk	this product turned up 2 days after ordering very good value as lot more expensive in local supermarkets.		
uk	Great product & timely arrival which made a perfect birthday present. Would recommend using this website for those last minute gifts		
uk	Good quality champagne. Would recommend this champagne for any occasion. We really liked this and so did all our guests.		
uk	This really is the smoothest bubbly I've had , even better than some of the more expensive brands , Fantastic drink		
uk	I bought this for my niece's 18th birthday present and it is really quite impressive looking! I can't comment on the taste but it certainly looks perfect to give as a gift. It does not come with a box but it was extremely well packed and delivered promptly. I found a really cute wine bottle bag in pink that was perfect to present it. I have seen this for sale elsewhere for more money, so grab it from here as its definately the cheapest!		
uk	Really nice taste, brought it for my partner after she seen it in the hotel we were staying in couldn’t find it in a shop		
uk	Love this bottle looks stunning but havnt actually opened it for the taste.		
uk	I have bought a few of these over the past few months! Looks fabulous gorgeous gift and the recipients have always been impressed! I can't tell you how it's tastes but the initial first impression is definitely wow!! I wouldn't mind one myself 😊 Xx		
uk	Extremely well packaged for transit. Lovely colour of bottle and reasonable value for money.		
uk	Bought for my Wife as little pre Christmas present, bottle looks good taste is not great little bitter for my taste. Could do with a small presentation box to help protect bottle a little more against damage from inside packaging.		
uk	Packaged really well and the bottle itself looks great... tastes fantastic really tiny bubbles		
uk	Pleasant rose wine for a birthday present. The recipient enjoyed.	roserose	
uk	Not tried yet but I'm impressed with the bottle even if the drink itself isn't good		
uk	I bought for a xmas prezzie with both the gold and silver . They look gorgeous boxed altogether .		
uk	Given as an engagement present and was well received. Bought gold bottle for 50 birthday they were overjoyed.		
uk	It is lovely and I love the bottle but it did not arrive on time		
uk	Bought for the bottle which is stunning. Let's hope it tastes great too!		
uk	Superb in all ways. Bottle gorgeous, delivery and packaging fantastic. Tastes amazing. Will order again. Thank you.		
uk	Nice drink bought for the wife,came well wrapped a looks good ,so happy .		
uk	Delivery was very fast , very pretty bottle highly recommend thankyou		
uk	Purchased for a friends as a wedding gift which they loved, bottle has a lovely finish to it.		
uk	Ordered this for my wife's birthday and tasted great and good looking bottle		
uk	Yummy wine, beautiful bottle to give as a gift. Packaging from seller was brilliant, big box full of polystyrene and bottles were in what looked like a bag from outer space, but it kept the bottles secure and safe. Very pleased with this product and would recommend the seller, very fast and secure delivery.		
uk	Lovely house warming gift. Looked and tasted great.		
uk	It makes buying a bottle for someone that little bit special.		
uk	This arrived in a lovely box with ribbons. It was for a present for a big birthday. The recipient was over the moon and opened it, it tasted lovely.		
uk	Lovely booze lovely bottle nothing else to say really 😀		
uk	Honestly I don't understand the ratings this stuff is literally horrid		
uk	Recieved this as a Mothers Day present from my son. Very elegant bottle. The wine was sparkling and refreshing. Highly recommended.. I too have kept this bottle just like my Bottega Veneta Gold one. ..		
uk	My fave champagne the bottle is so sexy and classy would make a great gift. Tastes nice		
uk	Bought it for a friends 60th - she was very happy - eye catching bottle		
uk	Gold bottle is stunning I bought it for 50 th wedding anniversary ... Went down very well ...		
uk	The delivery was exactly as promised, however on arrival I noticed the bottle was heavily scratched, the product itself is actually gorgeous but I'm afraid the scratches were very apparent As this was a gift I am unable to return, if I had a longer time scale I would have returned it		
uk	Purchased as a Gift....they loved the bottle and the fizz.....		
uk	Taste great. Is sweet and alot better than the gold version		
uk	always good to have these on order for gifting people on celebrations		
uk	A Christmas gift for a friend whats not to love about Champagen..Came in a lovely presentation box.5 stars from Dave		
uk	Very good Champagne at a decent price. Bought for Christmas day celebrations, and it went down very well!		
uk	Bought this for a charity auction. Great price. Delivered quickly and safely.		
uk	Fantastic value for money, got in Black Friday deal for £27.99 a bottle.		
uk	Nice price and yummy! No Complaints (and I wrote this while sober)		
uk	Love Bolliger, Got lucky these 2 bottles at discounted price ! quick delivery		
uk	Bought as a gift for my wife on our wedding day for when she and her bridesmaids were getting ready. She absolutely loved it, although this has now backfired on me as I expect I will be purchasing this annually.		
uk	Bought as a 21st birthday gift. A delicious champagne for a great price and the box adds a nice touch if wrapping up as a present, rather than just being in your standard bottle bag.		
uk	Fit a friend who got a new job. She hasn't drunk it yet, but I'm sure she'll love her Bolli, darling!		
uk	This champagne belies it's price...it tastes like one of it's more expensive siblings! It is delicious and so very moreish. The attractive box in which it arrives oozes class as does this elegant champagne		
uk	Bought for a friend, it was nice but not the beat Bollinger I have had		
uk	bought it so kids could give it mum for her birthday; she loved it and nice box for a present.		
uk	Always watch for this at the right price - and then pounce!!		
uk	I bought this for my sons birthday and he was delighted with it. Thanks		
uk	First class all round! Information, delivery, packaging were all spot on. The product was excellent and enjoyed by all! Would buy again.		
uk	"A friend who is a fan of ABFAB has often hinted that she would love a bottle of ""Bolly"" so I bought her this for her last birthday and although we didn't share it she reported that it knocked spots off MUMM and TAITTINGER so I suppose that must be good!"		
uk	great service on an important birthday of a fine champagne		
uk	Top champagne , better than more expensive one's...		
uk	Absolutely divine. So smooth, even people who don't typically enjoy champagne would be surprised. Would definitely recommend.		
uk	Christmas Present but I am sure it will be enjoyed!!1		
uk	Arrived on time & was as expected. Lovely bottle as always.		
uk	Sent this on the celebrate a wedding anniversary, they were very pleased with it.		
uk	Fabulous value and mega quick delivery. Highly recommended seller from a very satisfied buyer		
uk	Gorgeous as ever! My favourite tipple. If only I could afford it regularly. Perfect as a gift for a special occasion though.		
uk	Sent as a wedding anniversary gift, very well received.		
uk	Was bought for a good friends special birthday. A special name for a special occasion, perfect		
uk	Superb quality and enjoyed by the recipient on his 70th B-day!		
uk	Always a great product, great price, delivery speedy!		
uk	"Bollinger is noted for being a very smooth champagne. Personally I find it a little on the ""medium_dry"" side. But ideal for getting a good start to the festivities, whatever they are for."		
uk	The service was brilliant and my brother enjoyed the 'Bolly' very much - terrific birthday present. Happily there was no documentation with the bottle which meant that he did not know how much it was either.		
uk	I'm not a fan of Champagne but I bought these as thank you gifts for friends who are Champagne fiends. Nicely packaged and expectantly overpriced for what it is (although Amazon's price was fantastic). My friends were happy, so happiness all round. Can't complain.		
uk	It's Bolly darling!! Although i order 2 bottles the same time but,the 2nd 1 came a few days later......so,if you're ordering multiples be prepare!!		
uk	fast delivery, great price, just need to sit back and enjoy!!		
uk	Great gift, sadly the recipient received the package without any notification on who it was from.		
uk	The man this was bought for said it is the champagne men like best so he obviously enjoys it. Very fast delivery from seller.		
uk	Although the champagne itself is as expected, it didn't come with a gift box as stated in the title. As this was for a gift I decided it best to buy another make instead, one that came with said gift box.		
uk	Boldly is the best, great value for money and will not disappoint		
uk	Quality champagne at a great price! Gift wrapped & well packaged & delivered promptly. Very happy 😊		
uk	I do so love Bollinger...It always is a guarantee... The name sake... From the crisp biscuity flavour of the special cuvee... And as you go up the ladder LA GRANDE ANNEE... To the R.D 1990... I'm no connoisseur at all... And am not of money at all... But I Know what I like and like it well... There are many Champagnes out there... I find to often vinegary and or very acidic... And I've tried a lot... Each to their own... The R.D Is truly like velvet going down sooo smooth...Would love be able to afford A BOTTLE of the next one up... Or taste it... YOU ASKED... ENJOY... SOUTH EAST LONDON...		
uk	Great stuff. Ordered it as a present, very pleased.		
uk	Great item, exactly what I was after and at a good price too (cheaper than any of the wine shops!)		
uk	A great bottle as always and a decent price, however it turned out to be a Lewis Hamilton special which wasnt really what I wanted as it was a gift and made it look a bit tacky		
uk	Great value under the Black Friday offers but otherwise better value good champagne i would get instead the rest of the time!		
uk	Great Champagne, Great Price. Nothing else to add. Buy all Champagne for the holiday season through Amazon now, as much better value then the supermarkets.		
uk	Nice drop of stuff and got it at a really good price		
uk	An easy to drink champagne for those that don't like champagne if they are being honest, so good for celebrations that all can enjoy		
uk	I only buy about 3 bottles of champagne a year- all over the festive period. But I like to buy something decent for Christmas day and for seeing in the new year. This year i was short on time so did a lot of shopping online. This was excellent, nice and crisp. Lots of little bubbles and not too sweet. Nice and biscuity like a gruet. I'll buy again -would've been £36 in waitrose		
uk	Fab packaging, great price! lovely fizz ready to drink on my birthday! :o)		
uk	The lid of the box was a little crumpled but that's to be expected with a postal delivery. It was just as described and I highly reccommend this champagne, it's a favourite!		
uk	Girlfriend bought this for her work colleagues 21st, was reduced to £20 with free UK delivery so was a good offer. I'm no expert in champagne but her friend seemed to like it, so would recommend it. Came in a nice box as well		
uk	Excellent Bollinger substitute if you can't quite stretch.		
uk	Bought this as a gift but couldn't give it due to severely damaged box. Didn't inspect upon delivery as never anticipated to see such a mess. Thoroughly disappointed.		
uk	Bought as part of an engagement gift so not sure of the taste but it did look nice and was a good price.		
uk	great product, great value, great service, delighted customer and I will use seller again if I can.		
uk	Bottle was perfect.shame it was orderd for a specific reason and to my huge disappointment my note was not included.		
uk	A decent champagne at a really good price. 24h delivery was fantastic		
uk	Mixed nicely with the orange juice, nobody complained	orangeplain	
uk	Nice Champers, I don't drink much and hate moet, bought this because it was on promotion but everyone commented how nice it was.		
uk	NO COMPLAINTS FROM RECEIVERS. AND BOOSTING EXPORTS FROM THE COUNTRY WHERE I LIVE MOST OF THE TIME.		
uk	Its my favourite champagne in the middle price bracket... so when its on special for 20 pound.. you cant beat it.		
uk	Great value for an old reliable. If in Champagne visit the House of Mumm.		
uk	Regular favourite of ours for a mass market champers, slightly sweeter on the palate although definitely brut. Once you have a product to aim for, it is a simple commodity purchase as the offers are presented. This was cracking value with the discount offered.		
uk	Still waiting to drink but I know I love this champers so can't wait		
uk	The worst champagne I have tasted in this price range		
uk	Pretty good champers. There are better, of course, but not at a price I am prepared to pay.		
uk	Mumms is a very nice champagne for the price point. Considering competition from people like Moet, LP, etc, I find Mumms to be a higher quality champagne than the rest. It is extremely effervescent - probably the most effervescent champagne I've had - which can detract from it a bit, but in terms of the flavour, it definitely triumphs over some of the 'big name' NV £30/bottle competitors.		
uk	This has a very subtle woody nose to it, with a back drop of caramel. It is easily drinkable and has a very smooth taste in your mouth. It may not be the best champagne that you will ever drink but the price makes it more accessible without splashing out way too much. You won't be disappointed but equally you will not be raving about it to your friends. It is perfectly acceptable for the price and you won't feel ripped off. I would probably recommend it for an occasion with a partner or close family, but not as an extravagant present because it is not that. I would buy this again in the future but won't be stashing up.		
uk	This champagne tasted more like Cava. It was gassy rather than bubbly and I didn't enjoy it at all. I would not recommend it and won't be buying it again.		
uk	No box as advertised, took a while to be delivered to say its in stock!!		
uk	This Champagne is great value at £22 a bottle, and is ideal to take to people as a low key gift. The bottle looks nice and is recognizable and the taste is passable. I must say, I don't love the taste and there are certainly better champagnes out there. It has an unsophisticated and light taste which passes quickly from the pallet. However, also worth noting that I'm not the biggest fan of Champagne at the best of times.		
uk	Delivered on time and, as the saying goes, went down very well.		
uk	Lovely taste, long lasting bubbles. Excellent value		
uk	Crisp on the nose with a deceptively honeyed finish. Small bubbles on the palate which I've heard is the sign of a good one. Picked this as a recognisable brand and it didn't disappoint for the price. Good with nibbles.		
uk	Honeyed apples and lemons on the nose, very pleasant and fresh tasting - perfect with oysters		
uk	Not as pleasant as vintage. I would order vintage next time		
uk	Was dubious about trying this as I hadn't heard anything about it. So I first read the reviews and they all seemed to agree that this really was a very good product. Well I've had no complaints and I would now always buy this one - even if I do have to order it on Amazon - I think it's worth it. It has a lovely taste and it's not dry like some prosecco are. Give it a go, I don't think you'll be disappointed, it's far too easy to drink.....		prosecco
uk	Delicious Prosecco. Perfectly balanced, slightly fruity, just right! This went down a treat (and far too quickly) at our office party.		prosecco
uk	Far too easy to drink as it doesn't have that slight note of sourness I usually associate with sparkling white wine so I have never bought too much before. Looking through my Amazon order list I can see we have now consumed 12 bottles in fairly short order .. and I'm here buying more ...		prosecco
uk	Purchased this item twice as I loved it so much and will definitely purchase again. Lovely taste, a little more expensive than the average supermarket process, Well worth the cost. Took me a long time to track this item down at a reasonable cost.		prosecco
uk	Lovely you really know you getting something special when you drink this		prosecco
uk	Very good product all three were presents all ladies said a really good Prosecco very satisfied so I was pleased		prosecco
uk	I LOVE this Prosecco. It's my favourite of any Proseccos I've sampled to date!	daterose	prosecco
uk	Bought as a gift and my boss said it was the best prosecco she'd ever had. I'll be getting some more come christmas :)		prosecco
uk	been looking for this for ages amazing stuff best price for it very happy		prosecco
uk	Love this prosecco, it's the best one I've tasted. Good price for 3 bottles & quick delivery, will definitely order again.		prosecco
uk	Arrived very quickly and excellent value for money...delicious!		prosecco
uk	Very nice prosecco, this is the second time I have purchased this product as a Xmas gift		prosecco
uk	I bought these 3 bottles for the family over the Easter weekend, wanting something that I couldn't buy at the local supermarket. I tried these out with the family and we all agreed that they are far superior to the usual quaffing fare that they are given. Well worth the money, they came well wrapped and securely packaged with no problems at all. A few hours in the fridge and they were ready to drink, once the family got their hands on them they didn't last long, but were enjoyed by all!		prosecco
uk	Nice, posh looking bottle and delivered to the door.		prosecco
uk	Tastes great and i like it alot ..but for a tenner a bottle u'd expect it to pretty good.. there are no better deals though unfortunately from what ive found.		prosecco
uk	After reading the other reviews I thought I'd give this a try. But I have to say I've tasted better for less money. But its prosecco and it will be drank! I think it may need some Gin raspberry coolie to make it more drinkable lol	raspberrythin berry cool rose	prosecco
uk	A fantastic Prosecco, at an unbeatable price! I have been a fan of Bottega's Proseccos for some time, however, I was confused between the differences of the Vino Dei Poeti, Gold and White Gold. In a small home blind taste test, my partner and I both opted for this as our favourite of the range: in particular for its light, smooth, crisp apple notes that would pair so well with a chicken dish, but is a delight even when enjoyed on its own. This is Bottega's flagship Prosecco, produced in the famous Prosecco region of Veneto. It's my number one favourite Prosecco and is very highly recommended! I purchase it time and time again for all sorts of occasions.	applecrisp smooth apple light rose	prosecco
uk	I bought this as a gift for my sister and she LOVED it!!!!! Declared it was the nicest Prosecco she's ever had.		prosecco
uk	The only reason I have not given this 5 stars is because it was a special birthday present and I had asked for a note to be included to let my friend know who had sent it and wishing her a very happy birthday. This was not done and she had to ring various friends to see who had sent it to her.		prosecco
uk	Just arrived and opened. Really lovely light drink for the afternoon. So fabs I ordered another 12. Update another 12 arrived. Hopefully Try to keep for warmer days. Update . 1st Feb 2018. Just ordered another 12. Mum and I love this drink. Its fab and the low alcohol makes it a a suitable drink for daytime. If you haven't tried it because you think the price is too low. Try it Update march 2018 ordered 6 for mother's Day. Lovely present		
uk	This low alcohol fizz makes a nice light refreshing change. It is very pleasant to drink and at this price a bargain. Bought 12 bottles for a Ladies Evening and everyone commented on how nice it was. Have ordered more for Christmas and would recommend to anyone looking for something that's not going to give you a headache and easy to drink.		
uk	great plonk, especially for the summer, and at this price, great anytime. Seriously makes for a great wedding breakfast drink,heaps better than champers, as some weddings are held at places some distance from the guests homes, so that they can drive home in safety. One glass of this is not going to go to their heads,		
uk	"Lovely wine, light and refreshing. Ignore the ignorant people who've given 1 star reviews because they failed to read the label properly. A ""light"" wine is obviously lower alcohol"		
uk	I am certainly not what you might call a wine connoisseur but to me this tastes very pleasant and comes in a nice bottle. I have absolutely no idea how they can produce, bottle and ship six bottles for such a low, low price. I am certainly very happy with my order.		
uk	We love this! Really pleasant and refreshing to drink. Delivered in time and very well packaged. Will definitely buy again! Thanks I love shopping with Amazon, so easy. 😁		
uk	First order got lost in delivery replaced straight away though Can't beat this price not tried but really good value		
uk	arrived quick, great price, got them on black Friday, really cant complain. happy happy happy		
uk	Lovely wine good size bottle and was delivered quickly		
uk	Excellent value 5.5% ABV sparkling Rose. Not too sweet or too dry, very pleasant !!	rosesweet dry rose	
uk	My guests loved this, bought on Amazon Prime day for £2.82 a bottle! Bargain!!!!		
uk	Excellent light fizz. We used this for our welcome drinks at our wedding and everyone commented on it. It also due to the lower alcohol content was a very nice start to the day.		
uk	I thought it was excellent value & I'd certainly it again. Quite a light refreshing fruity flavour, I think a bit strawberry-ish!		
uk	An excellent refreshing fruity wine. Not too alcoholic and presented in the traditional JP Cheney leaning bottle.		
uk	quite good for the price was a gift for my sister she liked it		
uk	fantastic value for a great light and fruity wine - can't wait for offer to be repeated. packaging was exceptional in its strength and protection.!		
uk	The fact that it is low i alcohol is a plus. We drink it most week ends!		
uk	Delicious if you enjoy a lighter more delicate tasting wine		
uk	Just doesn’t taste right to me. Almost all guests either refused or just had a sip. Probably works for who has a taste for vey seeet and flavoured bubbly.		
uk	I received my JP wine today I only had 5 bottles in the box and 1 bottle was leaking thanks B Connor		
uk	How could a sparkling wine so affordable be so delicious? Currently saving up to but the whole vineyeard...		
uk	fantastic wine, served it with strawberries and toasted the Queen on her birthday		
uk	Was okay nice drink at the end of the day and for the price		
uk	I'm a rum lover, but if I have to choose a rośe wine, this is the only one. Love it		
uk	Arrived very quickly. well packaged, lovely sweet refreshing wine.		
uk	Labels of three bottles damaged and scratched, not a great look when you want to use these as gifts!		
uk	Didn't realise they were only 5.5 Vol. Bit too fruity and light for our taste.		
uk	We bought this for a summer drink. When we finally got around to opening the box we were surprised to see that it's alcoholic strength is only 5.5% rather than the 9-13% one might expect to see on a wine bottle. (I thought I'd missed the strength in the description but a recheck and I still couldn't see any reference to it....putting me off buying any more plonk this way. It is pleasant but it makes me wonder how many others buy this item only to you have the same feeling?		
uk	For a drink that wants to be called wine is – under EU law – required to have a minimum alcohol content of at least 8.5per cent.		
uk	Thought this was a bargain until I reveived them and realised the alcohol percent! Ooops my bad! Like drinking lambrini! Ok if u don't like strong wine. Refreshing		
uk	Present for the Missus and she loves it, very refreshing and a bargain on the lightning deal.		
uk	Excellent value-ordered for our wedding for the more 'light weight' guests :)		
uk	It didn't say it was only 5.5%........ gutted false advertisement 😠		
uk	This wine is very light 5.5% so could be an ideal drink for a lunch time or just for someone who doesn't like a heavier sparkling wine, is lovely with strawberrys too. I would recommend this and for the price u can't beat it really. Iv tried some other light sparkling wines an they tasted almost like sweeteners in fizzy water.		
uk	Bought to put in medium/large sized hamper! Wanted something smaller then your average size bottles so it didn't over shadow the rest of the treats so it worked very well in doing so. Such a gorgeous colour wrapping to it aswel. Price was ok but i thought postage charge was bit much. Although in their defence it came well protected to prevent glass breaking.		prosecco
uk	Tastes good. Bought as a gift in a hamper. Didn't want to buy a big bottle which would have overshadowed the other small presents.		prosecco
uk	This was a present which impressed the receiver and thoughlly enjoyed it ,as a token it was ideal		prosecco
uk	Well this was a present but I was so jealous, it looks so snazzy and really expensive. It was great value and arrived well		prosecco
uk	So cute!!! Makes a great present came well packaged.		prosecco
uk	Was a gift, so I can't comment on the taste but the bottle looks lovely.		prosecco
uk	I liked the feminine look of this bottle of prosecco which was an ideal gift for my friend. It is a nice size and looks good quality.		prosecco
uk	Putting together a pamper hamper for my mum this Christmas and this will be a perfect addition.		prosecco
uk	Lovely bottle but didn't realise how expensive the p&p would be so was quite expensive but a nice gift!!		prosecco
uk	Arrived on time, secure packaging, no damage to the bottle, very happy :)		prosecco
uk	Excellent service. Would use again. Highly recomended.		prosecco
uk	Used these to put in the Bridesmaids proposal boxes. The girls love them		prosecco
uk	Perfect little bottle for my wedding gift bags thank you		prosecco
uk	Bottles look lovely, but it is actually BRUT not PROSECCO as stated. Brut is much drier than Prosecco, not sure I can give them as the gift intended!		prosecco
uk	Was disappointed this didn't come In a box! Probably worth getting a bigger bottle in your local super market		prosecco
uk	Was a present and bottle arrived scraped, making it look bad		prosecco
uk	Great as a Christmas gift even better with PopaBall juicy Bubbles.		prosecco
uk	Lovely pink bottle for a present for someone who loves pink and proseco!		prosecco
uk	Great little stocking filler! Arrived super quickly and very well packaged, Thank you!		prosecco
uk	Didn't realise this was going to be such a small bottle, glass and a half at most ! Nice bottle as a gift but expensive		prosecco
uk	Got as a present for someone it came on time an well package The receiver was very happy with this an said it was a lovely present an tasted very nice! Will buy again		prosecco
uk	Oh no!!! My bottle was corked, after all the good reviews I was so excited to give this to my mum as a gift but it tasted corked :(		prosecco
uk	This is my favourite prosecco, so thought I’d buy a bottle for Christmas! In my opinion the best prosecco there is. Delivered very quickly this morning via Prime.		prosecco
uk	I gave this to my teacher as a thank you present for everything they had done for me, they said it was lovely		prosecco
uk	Very nice looking bottle... AND TASTED GOOD... Impressed my lady friend and made a nice evening much better ;)		prosecco
uk	Stunning bottle that made an excellent christmas gift. Very well packaged.		prosecco
uk	Purchased this a gift for a friend who drinks nothing but Prosecco. She loved it, looks fantastic and tastes amazing. Quick delivery.		prosecco
uk	Looks the part and made a nice gift for my other half. Tasted alright too.		prosecco
uk	The receipient was delighted with this Prosecco and loved the bottle. Item arrived in good condition and very quickly, so well pleased all round.		prosecco
uk	Nice tase, but let's face it the bottle is the real gift		prosecco
uk	Delicious Prosecco. Wonderful presentation for a gift.		prosecco
uk	I've had this before and it is outstanding. Looks very pretty and tastes awesome. My favourite prosecco by a mile. I usually pay over £20 per bottle, so when I saw this at £16 something I had to get it. I only wish I had bought more.		prosecco
uk	One of the best Prosecco out there. Very expensive but worth it as a nice treat and good substitute for fancy french champagne if you don't want to spend that kind of money		prosecco
uk	Impressive gift for a golden anniversary!! Perfect!		prosecco
uk	Simply the best tasting prosecco under £40. Creamy and light, it's a delight on its own, with enough light elderflower notes on the nose and on the palette to make it a great alternative if you find Brut Champagne too dry. My favourite summer prosecco.	elderflowerdry creamy light rose	prosecco
uk	good quality product, great for a special occasion.		prosecco
uk	Just like your standard bottle of wine. But gold! Good gift, went down a treat.		prosecco
uk	I bought a bottle of this for a party (because, you know, it's gold!) and when we tasted it I was pretty embarrassed to be honest. It wasn't as good as a £9 bottle I then went and bought from Tescos. You can also buy a nice bottle of Champagne for less money (Nicolas Feuillatte, £17 from Tesco, which is admittedly a bargain). At the same time, I bought 6 of the mini bottles for when I didn't want to open a whole bottle. They're just as bad, but at least they have a purpose.		prosecco
uk	Really is a very nice prosecco! Brought it for New Year's Eve and not only does it look the pat but tastes very nice too!		prosecco
uk	Bought as a present looks great and also tasted really good!		prosecco
uk	I'm sure the recipient will love this gift. However when you order gift wrapping on something you don't expect it to be the most boring brown rubbish that makes the gift look like something you don't want to open. That takes some effort		prosecco
uk	Would have given 5 🌟 but no message with bottle as requested?		prosecco
uk	Gift for mother, she loved it, saving it for special occasion.		prosecco
uk	This is a Christmas gift for my good friend who loves nice quality prosecco. bottle was in perfect condition and this is a lovely drink makes a wonderful gift.		prosecco
uk	Bought this for some friends for their engagement present but got lucky and they popped it when we were visiting a few months later so got to taste it. Tasty fizz and the gold bottle gets you acting all crunk like you in da club.		prosecco
uk	Best prosecco on the market. No after taste, not too fizzy, very nice taste		prosecco
uk	Love this prosecco! One of my favourites. Easy to drink, not too dry nor sweet. Highly recommend		prosecco
uk	Neither my wife or myself were that keen on the flavour.		prosecco
uk	Lovely bottle. Perfect for that special birthday, anniversary etc. Wine was perfect too.		prosecco
uk	Bought this as a gift for my parents Sapphire Wedding Anniversary. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Very well packeged. Beautiful taste and the bottle looks beautiful. Highly recommended. Great value for money. Perfect for any special occasion or as a buy for self indulgence! Cheers.....		prosecco
uk	I bought it thinking it was some dessert wine. Wasnt as sweet as I would like it. Since it is the same price as the rose version, I would recommend the rose version over the gold version.	rose rosethin sweet rose	prosecco
uk	Bought as a present and was well recieved! I do not like wine/prosecco however I did have a couple of glasses of this. Nice after taste.		prosecco
uk	Bought this for my friends leaving present, great looking bottle, looks way more expensive, thank you		prosecco
uk	Beautiful item. Bought as a gift and I'm sure it will be gratefully received. Thank you very much		prosecco
uk	Lovely bottle colour, bought as a present & it went down very well 👍		prosecco
uk	great. bottle was a wedding present, reminded me of James Bond		prosecco
uk	Honestly I did buy this for the bottle, I wasn't expecting too much... I was very pleasantly surprised, I'm not sure it's worth 3 times the price of an average Prosecco for day to day drinking but would make a very striking gift. Has a lovely fruity nose and is very smooth to taste.		prosecco
uk	Lovely attractive gift and nice wine. Would recommend.		prosecco
uk	Fantastic bottle of Prosecco! Very pleased. Thanks!		prosecco
uk	Amazing looking bottle. Haven't been able to open it yet as it is so pretty !		prosecco
uk	It was a birthday gift to my cousin and he loved it!		prosecco
uk	This was bought as a present and was well received.		prosecco
uk	Very happy with item, service was great and so was delivery also, arrived even before delivery date		prosecco
uk	bought as a gift. it looks absolutely gorgeous & it tasted as good as it looks.		prosecco
uk	My boyfriend loved it! Tasted amazing- perfect to celebrate a special occasion :)		prosecco
uk	Loved this - perfect for a special occasion. Tasted really great too!		prosecco
uk	The bottle was so festive for Valentine's Day! Really good Prosecco.		prosecco
uk	Drank this on the train up to London and went down a treat 👌🏼		prosecco
uk	Exceptionally well packaged. Item exactly as expected. Great gift.		prosecco
uk	"Really good prosecco. My wife and I are big ""fizz"" drinkers and stock both champagne and prosecco and have to say, this is our prosecco of choice. It's on the sweet side (if you want a dry one, go for the rose) but that suits us fine."	rosesweet dry rose	prosecco
uk	Was a gift to my other half on Valentines. Bottom line... He loved it! Looked expensive and came perfectly packaged in custom bottle bubble wrap, very clever. Perfect last minute gift!		prosecco
uk	I bought a bottle of this for new year. The Mrs and I popped it at the bells and we rather enjoyed it. We don't drink often so after two glasses each the bottle was bottle done and so were we. None the less we both really enjoyed this Prosecco, it has a lovely taste and I will maybe try some of the others in the Bottega range in future.		prosecco
uk	Yeah looks great but taste awful plus the alc % is so low you think this a drink for kids , if you buy it for an adult, they going to drink it and give you this look -____- , like why son/ daughter why you doooooo this to meeeee , don't waste your money and don't buy it as a gift for your parents birthday like I did, and buy a proper drink that gets people a lil satisfied atleast		prosecco
uk	Brought for my girlfriend at Christmas 2017, although my girlfriend appreciated it, she did say that for the price paid you can get very good bottle of champagne.		prosecco
uk	Very impressive gold bottle, great gift. Quite pricey for what it is though.		prosecco
uk	Love it only bought for the beautiful bottle great for wedding gift 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽		prosecco
uk	Purchased as a present for my mum and she loves it, so much so she does not want to open it. Giving 4 stars as i do not know what it taste like.		prosecco
uk	Absolutely stunning presentation bottle.....pic doesn't do it justice at all.....recommend as an exquisite & expensive looking gift at a reasonable price for a special occasion. Extremely well packaged in a protective airbag sleeve & double boxed, so plenty of special care taken by vendor to ensure gift arrives unbroken and undamaged. Fast delivery & faultless service!! This is a special gift for my best friend & her husband's joint big 0 birthdays in July so cannot comment on the bottle's content!!		prosecco
uk	Initially received as a gift for my birthday. Stunning bottle which made it very hard to open the bottle, it looks much nicer on my shelf than the recycling bin! The actual drink is a dry Prosecco, which makes it a easy drink to enjoy with any part of the meal, it is ideal with cheese at the end of a nice meal. Prosecco isn't quite the same as Champagne, being made with glera grapes instead. Prosecco also doesn't continue to ferment in the bottle, like Champagne, so will grow stale with time. However Bottega's gold bottle does aim to minimize this, blocking any sources of light, giving the Prosecco a much longer life. This Prosecco looks fantastic, and is a real treat as a gift or even to whip out after a dinner. The bottle always gets passed round for some ooohs and ahhhs The price is the last point I'd like to make, and it's the clincher. I haven't have the blessing to meet such a nice drink at such a low constant price. It's always reasonable in stores, but for Amazon to offer this at the best price I've found, with the secure shipping is perfect.		prosecco
uk	Whow amazingly super fast delivery which was also free. Ordered Friday and received Saturday and that was standard delivery. This bottle came very well packaged very secure. It is a stunning looking bottle and would not look out of place in a Bond film. I ordered this as a birthday gift and if the wine Taste's as good as the bottle looks this will definitely go down a treat. My only complaint is it should come with something to put it in as all of those ordinary bottle bags do no justice. Not one glamorous enough for the bottle. Would definitely buy from this seller again.		prosecco
uk	Got this as a present for p e of my family members. They loved it, the bottle stands out and looks to be more expensive then it is. The prosecco is nice as well but to be fair you are not buying this for the alcohol inside, you are buying the looks. If you are looking for a present to give or wanting to treat yourself to something nice I would recommend this to buy.		prosecco
uk	De-bloomig-licious! A bit of tmesis for you to celebrate this delightful fizz.		prosecco
uk	Haven't opened yet but was given a gift of the same projector which was really crisp. Great price also.		prosecco
uk	This is one of the best Proseccos I've had, not as dry as Champagne and doesn't have the metallic taste that some of the more standard supermarket brands have. This has been up to £15.99 a bottle recently but now it's back down to £8 I'll definitely be stocking up! The bottle design is attractive and reflects the quality of the contents within and was well received when given out as Christmas Gifts.But this time they are all for me :-)		prosecco
uk	I bought this Prosecco for a corporate event and it has been a great success! Highly recommended		prosecco
uk	I bought this for a gift and it's a lovely bottle of Prosecco. She was over the moon with it!		prosecco
uk	Great quality and the bottle makes it look more expensive than it is, was well received as a gift		prosecco
uk	As I bought a these as gifts I don't know how t tastes until I ask the recipient. Beautiful bottle		prosecco
uk	Fabulous that is really from Italy, it has the label in Italian and everything. I'm so happy. It tastes as my prosecco. Totally recommended		prosecco
uk	Wouldnt say luxury fits the bottle but still good value		prosecco
uk	Bought this for my mother and she seemed to be pleased, she said the taste was nice. Good for any occasion.		prosecco
uk	I bought this Prosecco for a friend who was leaving work. It is beautifully presented and looks far more expensive than it was! In addition, although I was not lucky enough to have a glass, I am assure it tastes beautiful and a bottle doesn't last for long once opened! A very happy customer!		prosecco
uk	This came really well wrapped in a thick box, the bottle looks expensive I havn't seen one like it in the shops, would make a great gift for any occasion I would recommend to family and friends thanks		prosecco
uk	Good value. The bottle makes it look more expensive than it actually is (handy if you are giving it as a gift!). It is a very dry Prosecco, which may not be to everyone's taste.		prosecco
uk	Would highly recommend! Sent (along with a fancy glass too) to a friend for her birthday. She commented on how tasty it was and it disappeared on the same day! Fab price too, so much easier than buying in a shop and sending myself !		prosecco
uk	Have gave this a five star as received in excellent time, cannot comment on taste as a present for friends, but excellent reviews so am sure no negativity		prosecco
uk	Good quality Prosecco, and looks more expensive than it is, which helps when it is a gift :-)		prosecco
uk	Really not that nice maybe people like it but I love prosecco and this one just ain't for me doesn't have much taste to it I've had a lot better but least I've tried it		prosecco
uk	A lot bigger than expected! Came in a really secured box so was really glad! Definitely worth the money!!		prosecco
uk	Bought as Christmas gifts and everyone was exceptionally pleased.		prosecco
uk	The bottle was cracked a all of the prosecco had leaked out absolutely ridiculous!		prosecco
uk	Bought for my nephew for his birthday. He says the best Prosecco he has ever had. Cant get better than that as he usually knows his stuff		prosecco
uk	Delivery was a day late with no explanation (had NDD) and the gift note was not attached, meaning that the gift receiver had no idea it was from me and had to ask, which was disappointing especially as the other items in my order arrived on time. I'd imagine the prosecco was quite nice though		prosecco
uk	Got this for a friend who loves prosecco. Looks expensive and was reasonably priced. I can't comment on the taste as it's a gift. I'm sure she will love it		prosecco
uk	Great packaging. Gift wrapping was beautiful thankyou not tasted as it was a gift to a friend		prosecco
uk	I bought this as a present for my friend, she informed me it was excellent and the perfect gift....		prosecco
uk	A really lovely Prosecco, very light to drink - a favourite in our house! Great price too!		prosecco
uk	Superb quality, the type of Prosecco you would expect at high end market, well worth a try. My Mother-in-Law loved it.		prosecco
uk	Lovely prosecco, according to my wife as I hate the stuff		prosecco
uk	Nice champagne well worth the money. Nice on its own but great with strawberries or caviar. A+++ recommended. good stuff		
uk	I bloody love this champagne. Can't get enough of it. I have little taste as I drink it so fast I don't have time to taste it but I do like to enjoy it by attatching two straws together and drinking it straight from the bottle. It also looks nice and makes people think I am civilise 😂		
uk	I would highly recommend this product. I was a little worried to order as no one had reviewed this product. However I was pleasantly surprised. The order came quickly and was packaged so well I'm sure I could of dropped kicked it and it would still survive. The box was larger than expected. However after digging through all the packaging I found another box containing the champagne. So all in all very happy.		
uk	Friends 50 th birthday so seemed like a good idea for the Scot's lady. Arrived in good time and she was so pleased. Little pricey but did the job well.		
uk	ordered for a friend to celebrate her dog winning BIS, she was very pleased to receive it and it arrived on time too, thank you so much.		
uk	I bought it for a friend of mine and he just loved it. My purpose solved. Would definitely recommend to others.		
uk	Great product and price. Arrived in a plains cardboard box that made wrapping the item (as a present) a little easier.		
uk	Easy to drink champagne, even non champagne drinkers like it		
uk	No better than a nice bottle of prosecco or a less expensive bottle of champagne However arrived in good time and nice box		
uk	I save this champagne for the new jear Great sending job And A big price for the shipping Still thanks very mach Moet & Chandon Cu next jear Greets From Nico Brouwers the Netherlands		
uk	On offer at £25. Can't beat that for the reputation they have.		
uk	I can't tell you more than that really as we know if we like m&c champagne but I won't be checking it out persoally as I bought it for 2 very good friends of mine. Sure they will love it.		
uk	I have no idea how good this tasted (though I can hazard I guess) as it was a gift - and most gratefully received I understand.		
uk	Perfect. Quick delivery. Amazing product. I shoul order more... :D		
uk	My order has been cancelled in very late time, now the price is not what i expected.		
uk	Excellent Service My Daughter Was Very Happy With it, Thanks Once Again.		
uk	Run of the mill stuff,but you can't grumble at the price..		
uk	Got this for my parent's anniversary. Fills a generous amount of two flutes. Would buy again.		
uk	A nice easy going champagne, not to sweet. The only problem with this product is the delivery service. The couriers only deliver monday to friday 9 to 5 (ups) and refuse to leave any where or with any neighbour even if you specifiy this! The product was returned once due to me being at work and not able to take delivery and the driver not leaving with a neighbour. I explained this problem to poorly and at home to take the parcel in. I would never order alcohol again this way again. Amazon are fantastic when using Yodel or The Post Office.		
uk	It went down a treat with no hangovers the next morning !		
uk	unfortunately courier left it out in the rain and never left a card to say it had been delivered but product as described		
uk	Very fast delivery. Looks good and can't wait to drink it!		
uk	I ordered a bottle of champagne and received it within the next few hours on the same day. This was without any extra charges. I even got a text message informing me about this early delivery. I will definitely order from here again!		
uk	Bought it as a gift, and it went well! No complaints at all.		
uk	Ive bought this for a house warming gift for my boyfiend.....hope he likes it!!! Delivery time was fantasic, id say less that 24hrs. How it was packaged was a slight concern for me, but i didnt need to worry! I'll be ordering again soon as all of my friends are turning 30!!!!		
uk	I was so delighted with the gift I chose and sent to my sister for a SECIAL BIRTHDAY. It was reasonably priced and delivered on time. Would so recommend thus service to my friends and family.... THANKYOU Amazon		
uk	Delivery made as promised. Very satisfied with the service.		
uk	This product is familiar to us and has always been a favourite celebration tipple. Please drink it form a proper Champagne Flute to get the full benefit of the bubbles.		
uk	We've bought it before - very good but DON'T SEND MORE INFO. by email or by any other means, thanks		
uk	I gave this to someone I was in love with. I got negative reviews for my personality -which lacks sufficient fizz- and he got bored very quickly with my body but touch wood the champagne seems to have gone down OK - And one out of three ain't so bad!		
uk	Great gift! Was perfect as quick deliver and saves carrying it around		
uk	Love the taste and bubbles.. enjoyed the first champagne experience. Fizz lasted more than days. Definitely recommend this.		
uk	It was great champagne, will order again for next good occasion.		
uk	this chamapgne is lovely bubbly, very good, great for celebrations or just drinikng anytime if you can afford it, a great product		
uk	Premium brand champagne at a great price, what's not to like? This is the genuine article.		
uk	It's pronounced Mowet phonetically. Mo-Wet I am a little annoyed when I see folks call it Mo-a-ee. Which is wrong.		
uk	Speaks for itself. The only reason for a 4-star was because the box was slightly damaged. Not what I expect on a product of this value and quality but given as it was a present, I didn’t have time to return it. Not drinking the box though hey!		
uk	Created in 1968, this is the rose that put pink on the map for both men and women. Great taste, colour, aroma. Full richness of flavour, you can’t go wrong with a bottle of this classic	roserich rose	
uk	Ordered this from the black Friday daily deals as I love this champagne. Presentation box is really nice and the champagne has a great taste and good balance between dry and sweet.		
uk	Got on special offer. So for the price I am more than happy		
uk	Gorgeous Champagne presented in a beautiful box. Fantastic for a special gift/occasion.		
uk	One of my favourite champagnes. When it's on an Amazon offer like Black Friday it's even better.		
uk	All drank! I bought this on Amazon because I could not find it in the shops where they constantly told me that it is an outdated drink. I just happen to like it.		
uk	Good product competitively priced (at the time) , too much packaging but fast ship		
uk	Good value for price was a nice drink mixed with lemonade. The bottle actually is slight bigger than pictured so good.		
uk	My favourite - with next day delivery on prime- need I say more?		
uk	Vermouth varieties can be pretty confusing. As is the case here, white doesn't necessarily mean dry. Way back in history Martini Bianco started life as a dry vermouth but was sweetened to end up as more like a halfway house between a dry and a sweet vermouth (Martini 'extra dry' is their dry vermouth expression). If you want a vermouth that has the best of both sweet and dry characteristics then try Martini Bianco. With a dash of bitters and some gin it makes for a lovely, soft, 'just one more' Martini that'll convert anyone who normally finds them too dry.		
uk	My first ever Tawny. Stunning flavours. Wonderful texture. Surreal walnut like taste on the exhale. Suits my palate, woody, slightly fruity but not overpowering, with caramel and nutty aromas. Amazing experience. Ordered the 20 year and have an eye on some vintage too. Thanks amazon.		port
uk	Lovely taste, nice and light without being too sweet. I'm not a huge drinker, so I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a drink with friends, but not sure what to have. Although it started going down very fast once my friends got a whiff lol. Will definitely order again. Oh yeah, it was beautifully presented, too good for me tbh! Fantastic gift idea!		port
uk	God, betrayal. I'm a huge whisky drinker but I do indeed have a sweet tooth, and combining those two in the heavenly form of port should be damn near illegal, I can thoroughly say I drink a lot more port at home now and after noting the warmth of other cheaper bottles like Taylors, Grahams Tawny port is just another experience entirely, incredibly tasty, almondy, sweet and just enough complexity and it was smooth. I couldn't tell you the tasting or nosings because me and wuh lass demolished this bottle in less than 45 minutes easily. Had it ordered for £13.50 and it was worth every penny.		port
uk	An excellent 10 year old tawny port. I find this a good point between the overly amber 20 year ports (at a 1/3 of the price!) and some of the Ruby ports. The palette is very smooth, the usual fruity flavours and a sufficient body. I find mine best served slightly chilled (17-18deg C), with either some chocolate or madeira cake, it's a delightful drop.		port
uk	Very surprised at how good this port really is. Nutty, fruity and great value for money. Would recommend highly!		port
uk	This is my everyday quaffing port. You really can’t go wrong with this. Good value, great taste...		port
uk	Husband and brother in law very happy to receive for Christmas.		port
uk	Great Christmas gift the recipeant was very happy great price 😁		port
uk	What is there to say about an excellent tawny port? Loverly mmmmm		port
uk	Bought as Christmas present so cannot comment on taste, but very good value.		port
uk	Christmas present for a friend .He was well pleased.		port
uk	Lovely mild port. Came in time and good quality packaging.		port
uk	Fantastic Product and great customer service, highly recommended.		port
uk	Purchased this as a gift so went for the gift wrap option. as I've had things gift wrapped before and they looked nice so I thought go for it.It had just arrived in what only be described as a brown canvas sack (pillow case size) tied halve way down with a ribbon and it looks absolutely stupid!could have done better myself and saved £4.Be aware especially with Christmas coming.		port
uk	Bought as present so can't comment on taste but presentation is excellent		port
uk	A lovely drop at a cracking price. Decided to buy myself a nice bottle of port for Christmas and came across this one at £13.99 and what a bargain it turned out to be. Very smooth indeed and was well enjoyed for the four days that it lasted! I'm just gutted that it is now £20!		port
uk	Lovely stuff, waited to buy it when it was offer but stocked up!		port
uk	This is a perfectly good port with plenty of interest. If one thing puts me off buying in this category, it is that I find Taylor's 10 year old tawny more intriguing. Grahams has the distinct elements of fruit, fire (alcohol) and wood, but in my view the wood is subdued and the balance of fire over-pronounced because of this. The fruit is intense, very good raisin and dark cherry with an edge and a hint of liquorish, but the supporting cast lets it down just a tad. This means there is less interplay between the elements, and less complexity than there could be, from sipping to finish. I'm sure that if you buy Grahams you will not be disappointed, but for me Taylors, as a direct competitor in this class, has a lot more going on from the first instant to minutes after -- the variation is impressively curious. Having said that, the Grahams cuts through and indeed marries with Stilton better, while Taylors is one for solitary contemplation.	raisin cherrythin tar complex	port
uk	This is delicious port. So smooth and easy to enjoy with cheeses, salmon, fruit, capers. Yum.		port
uk	For a reasonably priced port, this had a high quality character. Will buy again (especially at the pre-Christmas price).		port
uk	I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT A BAD BOTTLE, BUT I DID NOT ENJOY THIS AT ALL, AND I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE! REMINDED ME OF OLD HARVEY BRISTOL CREAM SHERRY!		port
uk	Love it! My favorite kind of port wine. Less fruity than others.		port
uk	This is my favourite port but very hard to get hold of in shops. If you enjoy port this is definitely a must. Looks great as shift also as it comes in a lovely box.		port
uk	I would opt for a more expensive tawny. This was nothing special		port
uk	Bought as a Christmas gift, I was taking a chance on buying this as the receiver is very fussy regarding choice of Port: any worries I had were quickly dispelled when I was informed that I had indeed purchased 'a lovely drop' and said person was suitably impressed with this bottle of Grahams. Speedy delivery and well packaged to boot, I would recommend this reasonably-priced Port going by the comments from my friend and empty bottle!		port
uk	Absolutely love port and this was a gift for my partner but we be enjoyed it together. I also purchased the 30 year old one. That one is amazing. If you like red wine, that is an experience you absolutely need in your life. But the 10 year old is great as well. Recommend it		port
uk	This gift was very well received and met all expectations. We have always been completely satisfied with all our transactions with Amazon in both the UK and Canada. Goods have been excellent and deliveries on time. Thank you		port
uk	Very nice wooden container, quick delivery. Would recogmend to all :(		port
uk	I got this for 25 notes and got so runted, I tried to mount the wife and then set fire to our neighbours shed. Great purchase! Well worth a try.		port
uk	After a recent visit to Graham's lodge in Porto, I came away thinking that the excellent 20yr old Tawny Port was a prime example of a quality tawny. Extremely well priced for a quality port, with a lovely aroma and complex taste. Best served around 18 degrees (Chill in the fridge for a few minutes), its lovely to pair with dark bitter chocolate, or with a mature Gouda. Even Biscotti is an excellent companion. As a Tawny is already finished fermenting, it'll have a decent shelf life (6 months) as well, though you'll be forgiven for drinking it a lot quicker than that. Coupled with Amazon's good pricing, quick and safe delivery, an excellent purchase.		port
uk	Picked this up recently when the price dipped to the lowest ever in 2017 (thank you technology!). I have a sweet tooth so I wasn't bothered at all by the sweetness. Tastes of dry fruits - figs, raisins with a dash of honey. Goes well with dark, bitter chocolate. Delicious!	honeychocolate sweet dry bitter	port
uk	My wife bought me this for my 30th birthday based on the fact that (up until drinking this) Grahams 10 Year Old Tawny Port was my favourite. The difference between the 20 year and the 10 year is incredible, night and day really! It is similar in some ways but has such an additional depth of well-rounded flavour that makes it, in my opinion, streets ahead of the 10 year. For me I think the deep fruity flavour of this port is best enjoyed with a strong blue cheese…but that’s just my personal preference. I still very much like the 10 year port, but drinking the 20 year has felt like a real treat. This would make a fantastic present for those that already enjoy Grahams 10 Year Old Tawny Port. Absolutely fantastic stuff.		port
uk	I cannot comment on the taste as I received the 10 yr old when I ordered the 20yr old. No way to contact them on their page so returning item and won't be using them again.		port
uk	With the discipline of a Samurai, I managed to make this last almost a month. The taste... oh my god, the TASTE! An explosion of fruity sweetness, with a very thick mouth feel. The alcohol adds an almost cinnamony warmth in the finish that perfectly counterbalances the sweetness. I don't usually care for sweet things, but this is just wonderful. If it's on sale, buy it.		port
uk	Opened this on Christmas day and it's too sweet, almost like dessert wine.		port
uk	Nicely presented, bought as a gift so I cannot comment on flavour but it was well received.		port
uk	Nom nom nom nom nom! I now order one for every Xmas and it rarely lasts past Boxing Day with the family.		port
uk	I bought this as a gift for a friend's birthday. I was informed that it was a very good purchase :-)		port
uk	A great value / quality balance - it is far smoother than most other ports .....		port
uk	Really lovely port. `this is in no way comparable to the sweetened red wine you buy in Tesco that is labeled as port. It is more reminiscent of a liquor, with deep dark colour but still clear enough to see through it. Taste wise it is sweet but also very flavourful. Reminds me of raisins and dried figs.		port
uk	A great Christmas gift for our dear friends in the United Kingdom.		port
uk	This was a present for my husband which he is much enjoying		port
uk	Drank it in one session - I bought it at 20 years old, and drank it before it could age anymore.		port
uk	I have just bought this for my dads Christmas present and I must say I am outstanding at the cheap price. My dad loves port and so I thought I would treat him. Hopefully he will be impressed 🤞🏻		port
uk	This is the second time I have ordered this product. Good quality and fast delivery! Also this time round I asked for the item to be Gift wrapped for a birthday and it looked lovely!		port
uk	The person who drank it said it was amazing :) (I was given none so it must have been)		port
uk	Bought for my husbands birthday and he was very happy, quick delivery and a very nice port great value for the money		port
uk	Wonderful in all aspects from receipt of order to receipt of goods in less than 24 hours, and on to enjoyment of a high quality port thank you.		port
uk	A very rich and fruity Port which was delicious! If you can stomach the price tag you'll appreciate stomaching the Port :)		port
uk	I sent this port as a thank you gift my brother was delighted with it		port
uk	This was a present therefore I cannot make comment on the actual contents of the bottle.		port
uk	Bought this as a gift for someone who knows about port.I've bought him VERY expensive vintage port previously.Never heard him praise any of them as much as this.He says it's like nectar.		port
uk	received with thanks,speedy delivery 10/10,as they say you get what you pay for and yes It's worth the price tag		port
uk	Really good port, pity it's so expensive or I'd order more often.		port
uk	worth paying the extra for this on special occasions. Perfect		port
uk	Bought this as a gift for my fathers birthday. When i opened the Amazon box the presentation box was damaged which was disappointing Lets hope he enjoys the port!		port
uk	I do like my ports and generally by the 10yr olds as to not break the bank. But after having a bottle of this and at this price there is no comparison. Very very easy to drink, even the wife who hates port has been taping into my beloved bottle : (		port
uk	Goes down much too well. Could not fault this amazing bottle of port		port
uk	I didn't buy it from amazon. However I got the chance to try it at a wine tasting. A true forgotten classic. Nice and rich. Not to sweet. Flavoured with raising and dark chocolate scents.		port
uk	Very impressed with the delivery and price of this port. It arrived within 48 hours. Packaged superbly. I'm housebound and wanted this particular port as a gift for my partner. The price on this including delivery is pretty much the same as if I'd gone to a major supermarket. Fabulous! So thrilled Amazon had it and the delivery was so quick! Also really great it comes boxed in the Taylors port packaging. Makes it look really smart if it is a gift. Highly recommended. My man was really happy.		port
uk	Came very well packaged and well presented in its own box. Haven't opened this yet as it is for Christmas but based on the reviews it is excellent value for money and should go down a treat with the cheeseboard - or maybe even on it's own!		port
uk	A deep, rich and sweet port, full of flavour, with a lovely warm, boozy finish. The packaging is classy and makes this an ideal gift.		port
uk	A nice smooth port at a very reasonable price. Since I discovered this point of sale I have purchased all my porrt on Amazon		port
uk	Very good price and excellent taste, made a good present which I was able to sample when they opened the bottle.		port
uk	Really disappointed - I bought this as a birthday present for a friend, didn't open the packaging until it was time to wrap it and the lid to the 'presentation' box (which was packed inside two other boxes) was ripped in several places. It looked awful and I had to take the bottle out to give to my friend - it would have looked so much nicer in the box.		port
uk	very very nice bottle of port, didn't come in the box which was pictured but wrapped securely. The taste of this port is lovely and for the price is very good indeed and would buy again.		port
uk	I bought this as a present and it arrived without the box, as pictured, which is one of the reasons I chose this particular one. My rating is not reflective of the taste etc.		port
uk	MY PORT WAS 2012 NOT 2011. SWEET BUT NOT TO SWEET. NICE AND MELLOW NO AFTER NOTES. WELL BALANCED FRUITY PORT. WILL BUY AGAIN. WELL PRICED TO.		port
uk	Comes in a nice box, ready to drink straight away and tastes lovely. What else could you want?		port
uk	I have put this bottle in my fridge but I do love a tipple of port		port
uk	My first time drinking port - couldn't be happier with my purchase. This one is delicious!		port
uk	This port does not come with the box, as shown in the photo. Really disappointed as this is a gift and now too late to return.		port
uk	beautiful port so worth the price thankyou very much*****		port
uk	Very tasty. Not big port drinkers but we enjoyed it for Xmas.		port
uk	love this, and hope that the person getting it will think so too		port
uk	This port takes some beating. What more can I say. So smooth and tasty. Love it.		port
uk	THIS IS REALLY NICE PORT FOR A VERY INEXPENSIVE PRICE ( BUY THE PORT SIPPERS ) LOVELY,TANIA G.		port
uk	Maybe port is just not my liking.Maybe port lover can appreciate it. Nothing wrong with delivery/packaging		port
uk	This for is for a friend so cannot make a comment as to how good / bad it is.		port
uk	Fiancees birthday present, really enjoyed it, packed well.		port
uk	I am not a wine taster so my opinion may not be pertinent. This is firts time I tried Taylors port. Great smell and great taste just a little bit too strong for me but it's the port so as far as I know it should be strong.		port
uk	Bought as a birthday present - Arrived promptly and really well packaged - Really happy with my purchase and so is my dad - Great Gift		port
uk	I bout this bottle of LBV Port (which I have enjoyed before) as a present. because it was advertised with a box, I assumed that it would arrive (wait for it...) IN A BOX. It came as a single bottle, without the box in the photo. This review is not indicative of the quality of the wine, which I do commend. The seller would be remiss if they did not alter the photo and description of this product, and issue apologies.		port
uk	Excellent service. Exclemt product. Could not fault.		port
uk	Brought for a present, it was very well received, I was told it tasted very nice.		port
uk	Excellent seller&product-fast delivery -5star-would definitely use again-		port
uk	Lovely port was bout to accompany a bandy which is did well..nice rich taste.		port
uk	A very tasty bottle of Port. Made for a nice Valentine's drink.		port
uk	exceptionally well packed and delivered as promised		port
uk	This is a lovely drink and an excellent Christmas present for young and old alike. I strongly recommend it to you.		port
uk	Bought for my brother-in-law who enjoyed it immensely---as did the rest of the family, much to his light-hearted irritation !		port
uk	Part of a present - but I know it will be readily drank and enjoyed after dinner		port
uk	Disappointed item has not arrived with the box as pictured.		port
uk	Disappointed this didn't come with the box as advertiseductive in the picture. Was for a present.		port
uk	Tried for the first time and love it. Warms up the chest NICELY. My winter friend :)		port
uk	Taylors always delivers fine port. this was bought as a gift for my Brother in law as it is one of his favourites.		port
uk	Arrived safely and well packaged, A very well received christmas present went down very well with the port sipper glasses, I would recommend buying them together		port
uk	Product is great, but took a long time to arrive. It was a gift.		port
uk	Bought as a present so have not yet heard a reaction but as I have sampled the same product I am sure it will be well received.		port
uk	OK for the price but...Was on sale at Tesco so I checked reviews on amazon... all good so I bought it. I must say I am a bit disappointing. Was expecting more. It leaves a spicy/sour aftertaste. You get used to it eventually but definitely worth spending £7 more and getting the 10Y Tawny one. I'm a great lover of port wine. I once went to get water and came back with 5 bottles as they were at 50% off..and goes well with my cigars. This is for sure the worst I had so far. I'll be sticking to 10-20y tawny ones from now one.		port
uk	This was a gift, ordered from Australia. Very easy to order and received well by the recipient. Many thanks.		port
uk	Received these in good time. I have only taken them a couple of times and they have helped no end with my constipation but had no luck with weightloss but I think if taken properly they will.		port
uk	Purchased for a friend who likes the port, not tried it myself		port
uk	£12 in Sainsbury. Same lovely taste wherever you buy it.		port
uk	OK so I wasn't sure if this would taste like heaven or like drinking liquid poo BUT I am most impressed. The bottles are gorgeous, it was a rubber Cork so I don't mangle my fingers with a Cork screw whilst shouting to the gods and singing the song of my people... It smells fantastic, tangy with undertones of sweet chocolate heaven. (almost made me dribble) it tastes sweet but not too much, there's the typical red wine twang with smooth tastes of chocolate that leaves a pleasant after taste. The only bad side is how much of this product I will now be purchasing. Perfect as a gift or for just drinking at home after a crappy day at work. Highly recommended. Buy more than one bottle... You won't want to share.		
uk	Late arriving and not in the boxes pictured. Disappointing as was purchased for a gift.		
uk	I'm afraid I completely fail to comprehend why this wine is so highly priced (note that these are only 50cl bottles!) and highly rated. Perhaps, if you don't like the taste of wine but have a liking for super-sweet artificial chocolate-flavoured drinks, and are looking for something to wash down cheap chocolates with, then maybe this will be your thing. It wasn't mine. For the price and in light of existing customer reviews, I expected so much more. The 'chocolate' flavouring completely overpowered the subtle wine. I only found it bearable to drink having chilled it in the fridge and adding ice to reduce the extreme sweetness of it and allow at least a hint of wine to come through. Not worth the price. Could buy pretty decent port or Madeira and actually taste the care that has gone into the growing of the grapes and maturing of the wine.		
uk	Oh My!! I don't normally like wine, but I LOVE chocolate. So I thought I'd give this a go, because being an adult, I *need* to start liking wine in order to feel more sophisticated and adulty... This so called 'wine' (as in, the thought of combining wine with chocolate is mind blowing) is an absolute dream! From the moment you open the bottle, you get a glorious whiff of chocolate, then when you take that first sip it's just a rich, velvety, not too sweet (almost like a borderline Black Forest Gateaux) flavour which then goes on to warm your throat and gives you an inside out cuddle. Bought 2, drank 2, gonna now buy more! :)		
uk	This is a wonderful after dinner desert wine. The combination of red wine and chocolate pairs very well with deserts based around chocolate i.e. pears in chocolate sponge etc. It's an unusual combination which works very well. One friend however found they had a very bad headache the following morning even though they had only a small glass. This happened a second time - perhaps they have a problem with the combination of wine mixed with chocolate. The still thought it was delicious!		
uk	I love this wine, it has a lovely taste although I was gutted because when it arrived, later that day i went to Costco and saw it for £8.98 per bottle including VAT		
uk	Tasted this wine at a wine testing event, loved it and bought a couple as presents.		
uk	Went to Cardiff shopping centre a few weeks ago, the usual stall giving away free tasters of this wine. My first thought was to drink as many freebies as possible and be on my way. However this drink was great, I could go as far as saying amazing, smooth chocolate taste and was not over powering, ideal as I am hosting Christmas this year and thought would be a great after dinner drink. Yes I had four freebies, however ended up purchasing two bottles for £30 - I think, but at the time thought this was a bargain. Asked if I wanted more, where would I purchase, yep you right, Amazon, great to see that I can purchase two bottles for £20, however I still have to pay an extra £5 for postage and packaging, an overall saving of £5. Not bad, if you like good wine, this defiantly for you. You wont be disappointed.		
uk	I love, love, love, love this wine! Tastes so delicious and though its a bit pricey its worth every penny. I've tried other types and they are not as good as this item.		
uk	I went out to dinner with a friend recently and we were served this at the end of the meal. Oh my Lord, a fusion of chocolate and wine - it definitely doesn't get much better. I don't normally go for sweet wines; I find them way too sickly. This is different. From the first the aroma hits you, and what an aroma, a deep rich chocolate with the underlying spiciness of a good wine. It's a fortified wine, though, more like a port or sherry, with a distinctly pleasant kick to it. A steely shouldered little number. I fell in love that night with the Rubis, not with the friend who is now history. Now, I am planning to spread the love and treat my friends and family (only those who have given me presents) to a snifter or two at Christmas (assuming I don't neck it all before then - it has been known). Cheers. Slainte. Salud. Bottoms up! However you say it, enjoy! PS: This twin pack seems to be the best value out there, but I think it's a limited offer, so get you some now (but leave the bulk for me! Yes, yes, I'm a pig. It's been said before.)		
uk	Firstly I'd like to congratulate Rubis/Amazon on their amazing packaging. These bottles arrived in perfect condition, without a dent on their box. The wine itself is pretty rich but not overpowering, it is not super sweet and does not have the thick texture of other chocolate wines. It reminds my partner and I of black forest gateau. I bought this product as a Christmas presents for a friend and they love it. I feel it is best drank as a flavourful shot rather than a full glass of wine due to its richness (as others have mentioned it is more like port than a wine) but also tastes great poured over vanilla ice cream as a boozy dessert. This double pack is the best priced that I have seen and very much recommend it as a gift or for your own personal consumption.	vanilla creamrich chocolate vanilla sweet hot	
uk	Brilliant had it first time on the cruise ships and love it since, sams bottle same taste. If you love wine and chocolate. This is it		
uk	What Can I say this is to die for have bought this before as a gift this lot is for me this time.		
uk	This is a delicious dessert wine that I had a glass of in a restaurant and just had to buy some. Goes great with desserts that have a obviously a chocolate or say creamy structure.....as opposed to say a citrus base that are more suited to say a Muscat type grape.	citruscitrus chocolate creamy	
uk	If you're reading this thinking that chocolate and wine definelty don't sound like a good combination, then you had the same thought process that I did. I can safely say I was very wrong! This has a delicate taste, not too sweet yet it hits you with a face-full of chocolaty goodness!		
uk	A1+ Speedy delivery, Arrived well packaged Thank you		
uk	Beautiful Black Forest gateaux in a warming glass of wine		
uk	Any negative review of this gets 'unhelpful' votes - possibly from the seller? - but I think you ought to know this before you buy it: I have now 'shared' this with a number of friends, and the most positive comment was 'well, it was drinkable but we probably won't rush back for a second glass'. I am absolutely mystified by all the 5 star reviews. If you are considering a purchase, I strongly recommend you buy one of the miniature bottles first and see if this is for you. Its a fortified wine, not dissimilar in flavour to Buckfast, but hugely more expensive. Don't expect a deep, rich, chocolate flavour. This has a shallow flavour, with an aftertaste of artificial chocolate. Think sacharine, rather than brown sugar. If that's what you want, then enjoy! If not, there are much nicer products out there. I recommend a nice, rich Malvasia madeira if you're looking for something sweet (there are lots on Amazon to choose from).		
uk	Excellent wine. Always buy as presents and always well received!		
uk	Delicious and the hint of chocolate is the icing on the cake.		
uk	We have tried other chocolate wines but none come close to the flavour of Rubis. It used to be available locally but the supplier sold off stocks cheaply at £3 a bottle! After we finished that we are having to pay the going price which although expensive makes it a real treat.		
uk	This is really lovely stuff - I'd tried other chocolate flavoured wines in the past and found them to be quite unpleasant,either sickly or overpowering. When I saw Rubis was a lightning deal and read the excellent reviews I thouth I'd give it a try and am so glad I did! Rubus is sweet and rich without being too much - the aroma alone is almost worth the price! It's a perfect tipple to end a meal with or just to enjoy on a cosy night at home.		
uk	Great tasting wine. I gave this 4 stars due to the delay in receiving these wines. This rating does not effect the quality of the wine.		
uk	Smooth and beautiful. Delicious and a little too easy to drink. I'm not a port fan but I adore this.		
uk	Took a long time to arrive, but products great and well packaged. This wine is gorgeous!		
uk	Black forest gateau in liquid form basically. Really nice, but don't plan on drinking the whole bottle in one sitting :-)		
uk	It arrived on time and the taste is so delicious, I will definitely recommend this product.		
uk	Tried this at a wine testing event and was amazed how much it tastes like chocolate....my wife loved it so purchased a few bottles for her. One is being kept for a Christmas party but the other was drunk at a summer BBQ. Was nicely chilled and served over ice and was a lovely as I remembered. Agree that this is not something you would want to drink a lot of in one go (unless you have a very sweet tooth and adore chocolate) but for a little digestif after a meal it is a real treat. Probably not for all but if you like chocolate I would be surprised if you didn't love it.		
uk	I'm sure this product tastes nice , if only it were delivered !!!!!!		
uk	I absolutely love this chocolate wine, it is the best one out there. None of the other chocolate wines can even come close to this one (and I've tried quite a few now!). It may seem a little expensive (I save it for special occasions) but it is well worth the money		
uk	"I am not really a wine drinker, and I always struggle to understand why the bottle will say something like ""it has a hint of raspberry with a tone of melon..."" All I could taste was just a glass of wine! But this actually taste like chocolate, an adult version of alcoholic chocolate drink. This went down well after a Christmas meal and I don't like Christmas pudding."	raspberrythin berry chocolate melon	
uk	Lovely drink and a bottle would make a lovely Christmas gift for a friend. Good value from this seller		
uk	I first found this product at the good food show and fell a little bit in love with it, imagine my delight when half way through the first bottle there was this beautiful drink on sale! I bought this with the intention of giving one of the bottle as a birthday present and keeping the other for myself, but its far too decadent to give away. The wonderful mix of red wine with the smooth texture of the chocolate aromas, keep you coming back for more. Not sure if its a bad thing that you can only drink a small amount at a time though!		
uk	Delicious stuff. Pretty sweet, but great for special occasions. They come in nice presentation boxes, packed together in a brown cardboard box inside the Amazon box, so they make a nice gift either individually or as a pair. We will definitely be buying more of this in the future, both as a gift and as a treat.		
uk	Like Wine? Like Chocolate? Then you'll love this! Really great drink for after dinner. Not too sweet but with a rich chocolate after taste.		
uk	Pleasantly surprised by this 'wine' - although its less of a drink-the-whole-bottle wine and more like a sweet liqueur to sip making it a lovely topping for deserts or a small glass after dinner. Sort of reminds me of Baileys. I'd like the bottle to be bigger as the glass is quite thick and deceiving and you'd only get about 3 small glasses out of one bottle.		
uk	This must be the tenth lot I've brought, its excellent. Like a dessert wine with a hint of chocolate. If you like sweet wine and chocolate, you will love it.		
uk	"The wine connoisseur in me is afraid to admit that I've tried a wide variety of ""chocolate"" wine with the same results, ugh. But the Rubis Chocolate Wine is simply delicious. I first tasted it at a chocolate festival in London and bought four bottles on the spot. Found it much more reasonably priced here on Amazon. Serve chilled or pour over vanilla ice cream for a special treat."	vanilla creamchocolate vanilla	
uk	Having been introduced to this wine in a restaurant, I have bought these two as a gift. It's such an unusual taste, red wine with a hint of chocolate, and a really delectable change for a dessert wine. I don't normally like red wine, but I don't know how you could fail with this		
uk	This is a nice tipple, good balance of chocolate and wine flavours. Like port, not something I can drink a lot of in one evening. Quite telling that I purchased two bottles, one to keep and one to gift- and ended up keeping both!		
uk	love it, impressed as a gift. will buy again. I like it myself, tempting not to give away!!		
uk	I give this 5 stars for taste, delivery, packaging, looks and price. I saw this offer on Amazon Daily Deals, but missed out. When it was advertised as cheaper than normal I made the purchase and do not regret it. It arrived really quickly and was very securely packaged. It looks really attractive and I did not want to open the actual boxes at first. The first bottle was not refrigerated, but we added some ice to some of it as I found it very sweet and liquer like. I kept the second bottle in the fridge and it was gone within a week, it was so tasty. Would recommend and would purchase again, not to often as I would probably spend all day drinking it.		
uk	"I asked a female friend of mine what two things do all women love. Straight away I got the answer - wind and chocolate. ""What if I could combine them?"" I asked and presented her with the bottles. Brownie points!"		
uk	It's was great the first time, I'm never disappointed		
uk	This wine is yummy and tastes like the chocolate liqueur selection box but in a bottle. Harder to find than the standard stuff the supermarkets sell but so much nicer and comes in a nice quality box ready to gift wrap. Quickly delivered.		
uk	WIFE loves this wine if she!s a good girl might buy her more for xmas		
uk	So this is KIND of a port with cherry and hints of dark chocolate. It sits between a port and a desert wine, and is just a bit too sweet for some palates, but perfect for others. So far we have found it goes with some fuller cheeses like stilton on oak cakes, stolen and when you are too full a nice drink to go with an espresso. I have tried a few things to mix it with, but this is best served on it's own, preferably at room temperature or over ice This is not for everyone, but it's a great addition for the stay-at-home bartender and something different to end the night on	cherrythin chocolate sweet tender	
uk	This wine is totally amazing and loved by all who try it, however suspicious they may have been initially. It is beautifully presented and makes a great gift. They only downside is in its delivery. It cannot be delivered to Collect+ stores and delivery men are under strict instruction not to leave the parcel with neighbours... all of which makes it a real pain if you work/need to go out on a daily basis. They attempt 3 times and, if unable to deliver, the nearest collection point for me is a 40 minute drive! So, plan ahead when you order. The reward is worth it :)		
uk	Lovely tasting chocolate wine, seems a weird combination but it works. We were given a taster by friends and loved it. Recommended to other friends who also bought it. Hope that supplies can keep up!		
uk	I love this wine. If your thinking of trying it just go for it. My first consignment one was damaged buy this is being replaced. They come packaged perfectly for gifts at Christmas.		
uk	I had a chocolate wine (technically it is port) that is from Portugal and it was amazing, therefore I decided to buy another brand and hopefully to find similar replacement. I was bitterly disappointed by the differences as this wine taste does not match the fragrant. When I opened it I could smell the rich chocolate, however when I consumed the wine the first thing that hit me was the sweetness of it. It just taste like drinking syrup and any features of a wine was overcome by it. The chocolate taste does not appeared until the very end of the after taste. The chocolate wine that I had from Portugal had the sweetness but the sensation chocolate was throughout the experience, from when it touches your tongue to the after taste. Now I have a bottle and a half of the wine left and I do not know what to do with it.		
uk	Took a bottle each to mine and the inlaws family Christmas and it was loved by all. Smooth and fruity. Best description is that it tastes like black forest gateau. Lovely. I will be getting more.		
uk	I love this product perhaps because its chocky and wine but it is very nice. I will be buying more.		
uk	I absolutely love this wine! Bought it for myself last year and this year I bought two bottles as Christmas presents.		
uk	Excellent flavour, really rich dark chocolate. You should take the chance, you'll be pleased.		
uk	Absolutely love this - and was so pleased when it came up on offer. Couldnt resist, could I...		
uk	Fantastic delivery time and really well packed will use again and again A fun wine/port well worth a go		
uk	I'm not much of a wine drinker but this is great as a small dessert drink.		
uk	I don't know why they call it wine?! This is a liqueur and I'm not a fan of liqueur. What I've noticed you sleep so well...feels like I want to vomit when I have it.		
uk	I purchased these during Amazon's lightening deals as a gift for my best friends. I haven't tried this myself but I have it on reliable authority that it is very good! They arrived really well packaged from any damage in individual gift boxes so were perfect for Christmas.		
uk	Great item, well and securely packed. Fast delivery. Thanks		
uk	Can't get enough of this stuff (in a responsible fashion of course). Picked up a couple of bottles of Rubis at a Good Food show a year or so ago and loved it. Seemed quite hard to track down in the meantime but noticed it appearing on the Amazon lightening deals. Couldn't turn down a bargain for one of my favourite tipples. I'm sure this isn't for everyone, but a firm favourite with me and the missus.		
uk	Friends recommended this and my Wife loved it. Chocaholics delight.		
uk	I love chocolate. I love red wine. I mediocre this! :-(		
uk	Fantastic, my friends came round and this went down a treat........ enjoyed with ice was our favourite. The flavour was gorgeous, you could really taste the chocolate and the texture was rich more like a sherry or port. Compared to oth er's we definately enjoyed this Rubis.		
uk	Great tasting alternative to red wine, I recommend for everyone to give it a try		
uk	i bought these for a present for my Dad. i wasn't too sure if he would like them. he tried a bottle at Christmas and i was amazed as he reallt enjoyed it. A great dessert wine he said. He would have again.		
uk	Bought this for my mum's sweet tooth. It makes a change from sherry. She really likes it and I must admit that I' am partial to a small glass myself now and then.		
uk	Words can barely describe just how fantastic this stuff is, and in my 30 years on the planet never have I put something quite so delicious in my face. Move over mulled wine and eggnog, this stuff is pure Christmas in a glass. If you like wine or chocolate, both or neither, it doesn't matter. There is simply no way any sane human can not enjoy this. The only down side is that it's quite rich, and gets a bit sickly by the end of your second pint. I guess one more down side is that drinking by said pint prompts judgement from friends and family.		
uk	This wine is AMAZING! You can tell from the packaging that this is a luxury product. If you like red wine and chocolate this is an absolute must!		
uk	Have previously tried so know this is wonderful wine and makes a great gift. Was very disappointed however, to find that bottles, in this instance, did not come in boxes, as shown. Have now been assured by retailer that this was an oversight and that boxes are being dispatched, brilliant! Great Xmas gift for wine/chocolate lovers!		
uk	Feel that you can taste the quality. Had never tasted chocolate wine before although found the idea intriguing. It was a surprisingly great taste - velvety smooth, warming and with a chocolate tinge that is not overpowering. Expensive tasting. Reminds me of a cross between port and mead. I was concerned may have a sweet taste and I like strong powerful wines - it was not sickly sweet at all. Purchased from the Black Friday deals, however was only £5 discount so still more expensive than I would normally pay for wine. However this is not ordinary wine, it is fortified wine and is high quality. Based on previous glowing reviews, I took a punt and was glad that I did. My husband and friend were suitably impressed as well.		
uk	Brought as presents and they both love it! Delivered tge next day. Would use again thank you 😃		
uk	This is the best fine I have made, I don't normally like wine but this has changed my mine. If you are thinking of trying Rubis chocolate wine I say don't think just get. Have already order more.		
uk	Good red wine with chocolate flavour great over ice so good you have to order online cause nobody stock it near by		
uk	Bought as a gift which was well liked by the consumers.		
uk	It tastes a bit too bitter and the chocolate is kind of unpleasant.		
uk	Very tasty and impressed my friend as a present Would recommend even just to try out A must for red wine and chocolate lovers		
uk	Had it for an intimate celebration and was a total hit. Very good palate , goes well with a slow-cooked steak		
uk	Absolutely beautiful as usual. Would advise everyone to try it. It is not thick and gooey like you would imagine.		
uk	It smells and tastes good. I bought a 2 pack on a lightning deal for £20.50, much cheaper than high street shops and markets.		
uk	Everything I wished for :). Perfectly despatched and just waiting to be drunk. What more can I say? Try the wine its just heavenly!		
uk	I have reviewed this in the past. My wife loves it which accounts for the latest purchase. I have no hesitation recommending it.		
uk	Best wine EVER! So good! I just wish it was a bit cheaper so we could have it more often! It is really smooth and chocolatey. Amazing!		
uk	Delivered on time, packaging excellent, purchased for christmas present, have not sampled the wine myself YET, friend recommended and said it is lovely.		
uk	Wow this product is divine and has been ordered on recommendation by myself. Packing is ideal for a gift although it tends to be drunk before we have chance to wrap it.		
uk	mmmmmmm..........lovely, very Moorish but best drunk sparingly.		
uk	May become addictive for chocolate and wine lovers!		
uk	first brought this on the PO Oriarna my wife loves it over ice		
uk	this is a really good chocolate wine very moreish and worth its money		
uk	Not the most subtle of flavours but a gloriously indulgent combination of chocolate and cherry flavours nontheless.	cherrychocolate	
uk	Utterly delicious, so unusual and such a special treat!		
uk	Lovely! I'll be buying more now I've found it stocked locally		
uk	My second purchase of Rubis, delicious rich chocolatey red wine flavour, I can't imagine anyone not liking it		
uk	Always a winning christmas present for my mum, comes very well protected so no worries of breakages		
uk	Amazing stuff this. First saw on Borough Market with a much higher price! Crack on!		
uk	Little trouble with delivery but purely down to the courrier. Nicely presented and tasted great		
uk	Im not a great lover of red wine usually, this however is gorgeous! Be warned u will want more than one bottle x		
uk	if you have never tried it do so .Its a lovely tipple		
uk	A very rich wine, more like a sherry or port, but delicious!		
uk	Apart from cider this is my only alcoholic tipple and I'm devoted to it. It is an aperitif, not quite as sweet as a red Martini, having a herby taste and hint of bitters in the background. Everyone I've introduced to it has enjoyed and the only problem is tracking it down.Oddbins stopped stocking it about 3 years ago and few of the high st chains have heard of it. It is worth the effort searching and I was happy to find it sourced on Amazon, having finished my last bottle at the start of the year. This really is an excellent aperitif, try it! CARPANO Punt e Mes Vermouth 75cl Bottle		
uk	I much prefer this to simple red vermouth. Not that widely available in shops, but a good price and easy to buy via Prime.		
uk	One of my favourite sweet vermouths! You can really taste the difference when making a Manhattan, negroni etc		
uk	One of my favourites just served over ice with a slice of orange.		
uk	I bought this to make my Tuscan sangria authentic, and it did. Tastes great into the bargain. Could not get this in my local area, or from local supermarkets that's why I ordered this online.		
uk	For those who have not tried it you really should, it the best.		
uk	For some reason this is hard to find - even in high end wine shops. Great with lots of ice - either on its own or with tonic/slice of orange/lemon. Totally more-ish - beware.		
uk	If you want a flavour that sums up Italy then drink this. Genuinely Italian in all of it's glory, bitter and then the flavour comes through.		
uk	Delivery was excellently timed, and the product is as advertised. This is a most efficient way of procuring a difficult to find bottle of alcohol. The recipient of the gift was most pleased.		
uk	as expected - I haven't the spare time to go grovelling to amazon writing essays to help them sell even more stuff, so this is a standard rubric		
uk	I'm not a fan of the bitter aftertaste, and I wouldn't say it's worth the price tag over cheaper alternatives.		
uk	Although often used as a stomach remedy, Fernet Branca is also an excellent and unique herbal bitters for more general use. Try a dash in your favourite vermouth or cocktail. But you might want to buy a bottle pourer for it, as it's a standard 75 cl bottle with a wide neck. I use this one because you can screw the lid back on the bottle: Cap-On Freeflow Pourer - Pack of 12 | Bottle Pourers, Spirit Pourers, Liqueur Pourers, Hygienic Pourers, Speed Pourer		
uk	Fernet! Great for all occasions.. according to the Argentina's		
uk	Not quite what I expected but very nice. Extremely minty. Haven't tried it after a hangover yet but I've heard it's very good for that		
uk	Approved by czech partner,and they know their fernet,quality ☺		
uk	The best stomach remedy I've ever come across, eventhough the taste is horrendous. Any upset disappears literally disappears within minutes. I always have a bottle in the house....		
uk	We have always kept a bottle of this in the cupboard and would never be without it. Upset tummy etc., works every time.		
uk	"This is often presented as an antidote to hangovers - it's not, I have researched the matter thoroughly and I can assure that there is nothing that will prevent a hangover, if you try hard enough. But Fernet WILL aid digestion, and reduce reflux, and as such deserves a place of honour in the drinks cabinet of those of us who live our lives a little too fully. In honesty I drink it so regularly that I never put it back in the cabinet once opened, it's not worth it. It has an acquired taste - a neighbour teases me about this ""Are you still drinking that petrol?"" while her three sons think I am amazingly cool because I can knock back a double measure without blinking. My biggest problem is that I take it for therapeutic reasons and so overlook its alcoholic qualities..."		
uk	l have been using fernet Branca for a very long time it is a fantastic product and works wonders in no time at all thank you Beryl Tomlin l will always give five stars👍		
uk	Excellent product for shot after a heavy meal and good for the digestion. (Not a drink for every day drinking)		
uk	The best hangover cure in the world. Apparently a great way to take it is to mix 50/50 with creme de menthe and pour over ice. It does taste like medicine so anything to improve the taste is a great idea. Though perhaps the disgusting taste helps with the medicinal effect.		
uk	Arrived safe and sound, no complaints. Only issue is that I haven't gotten round to drinking it yet!		
uk	Now this gear is the dogs if you need a aperitif. Or a hairy dog this will make you feel brand new.		
uk	What's not been written about Fernet Branca already? Some hate it......Some love it....... A shocking slap to the mouth on first pass causing you to wonder why.....why? As the Marmite of drinks there are few in-betweeners. (Thankfully tho it tastes nothing like Marmite). Treat your tastebuds to a new experience and given the many ways there are to drink this little gem I'm sure you'll find one you like.		
uk	The mouth of the bottle does not bring the plastic pouring that all original Fernet Branca bring. This product does not seem to be original, taste different and when mixed with cola and ice does not make the usual foam. If you are looking for a real Fernet Branca, do not buy.		
uk	This stuff stained the glasses I poured it into and tasted like liquid tarmac. You can call it a digestif if you like but personally I would say this is a kill or cure for constipation. One glass of this and you'll lose your trousers, underwear and any sense of dignity.		
uk	My Mother who suffers with gastric ulcers whilst on holiday in Austria was recommended this stuff and it sorted her out . Also my wife suffered gall stone pain as was awaiting an operation and sometimes when she was in agony took this stuff and it was the only thing that killed the pain of that condition. I personally use it for either an upset stomach or diarrea and it helps , but this is known for a hangover cure brilliant stuff I can't recommend it highly enough.		
uk	Bought as present for my husband, as he used to drink it in Italy, and I can't find it in any shops in UK! He swears by it!		
uk	Why does this drink exist? Do people enjoy the taste of dirt and menthol?		
uk	Just came across this in a restaurant, and was curious about it so asked the waiter. He said it's an old secret Italian cure for stomach upsets. So I thought I would give it a try. Not had a bad stomach to try it on, but the waiter swore by it. It has a strong herby taste to it, not something I would just up and drink, like say a whisky.		
uk	An excellent digestif. Always helps with any gastric upset.		
uk	The finest wonder cure ever seen, seems to cure most things, stomach upsets, indigestion, just feeling not quite with it, you name it. I always use a 50ml glass filled to the top, gulp it down I one go, you will fill better within minutes, or if not it seems to nearly always make you happy enough from the alcohol content to make you not care. It should be available tax and duty free, it would cut down people going to the doctors, it perhaps should be available from the NHS. Always keep a bottle handy ;-)		
uk	very good for holiday stomach. More a medicinal than social drink.		
uk	A lovely clean drink after a heavy meal. I drink it ice cold and neat.		
uk	First experienced this in Dosin when one of our friends didn't feel well. The barman offered my friend a drink of this and within half an hour she felt much better. It ticks all the boxes, my husband wouldn't be without a bottle of this in the house. It's great for tummy upsets and hangovers		
uk	This was bought as a gift for a friend who had been given a glass as a 'pick-up' a long time ago, and still remembers and talks about how quickly and deliciously it had settled her upset stomach. She - and I - have been unable to find it in our local shops, indeed most people hadn't heard of it, so as a surprise treat, I looked, and subsequently ordered it on-line. It arrived within a very few days, especially at Christmas time, and was very securely packed. I am delighted with the availability and prompt, courteous service from this company and will certainly be using them again.		
uk	Gabulous product, tastes awful but one tot drank quickly is the best digestive, better than any indigestion remedy. I always have a bottle in the cupboard!		
uk	as expected - I haven't the spare time to go grovelling to amazon writing essays to help them sell even more stuff, so this is a standard rubric		
uk	I think its an acquired taste and needs a suitable mixer....		
uk	My husband swears by this for settling his stomach. Usually buy it abroad, pleased I can now get it here.		
uk	Very good price and very safely delivered in very quick time		
uk	I would stick to minty Listerine. It tastes the same and is far better VFM. Only a fool would pretend to other fools that this is not re-bottled toilet cleaner.		
uk	My daughter bought me this for Christmas. I normally use Underberg when I have over indulged but Fernet Branca seem to work as well if not better and works out a hell of a lot cheaper. I normally have a double shot and it works almost instantly.		
uk	"Love this stuff, having discovered it on ships. I've never suffered from sea-sickness but a wee dram can definitely pick you up when a storm is raging and leaving you a bit tired. It's basically like Jägermeister without the sugar, in terms of taste, although that doesn't do justice to it's effects, and Jägermeister is no substitute for Fernet Branca. It's a proper bitter digestif made from a gazillion exotic and potent herbs, roots & barks, originally devised in the 19th century to fight cholera if I'm not mistaken. It's widely popular outside the UK, especially after heavy meals or heavy nights, and it definitely works to calm the effects of both. It's basically the healthiest 40% spirit you can drink! A little goes a long way and I fully expect this bottle to last me at least 6 months. The taste can take some getting used to, although a few drops of creme de menthe go a long way to making it more palatable for novices; also, a milder minty version called ""Branca Menta"" is produced by the same firm. Chilling it well also softens it's bite. It's an ideal gift for somebody who claims to have tasted/drunk everything, or who appreciates good food but sometimes struggles afterwards. Only quibble is that it's readily available in many Italian/Spanish/German supermarkets (and the on the corresponding Amazon sites) for about 15 Euros, whilst we have to pay almost twice that. Looked at ordering it from Amazon Germany but postage also 15 Euros, so no advantage there..."		
uk	not for the faint hearted this one, and most definately an acquired taste. Impossible to drink too much of it, as it wont allow it..believe me !!		
uk	Very disappointed that I did not receive the item I paid for, instead I received Branca Menta. Disappointed but no point in the hassle of returning it.		
uk	I bought this on the express orders of my partner (she swears by it) and it is certainly an acquired taste. But it is great for soothing sore tummies and for indigestion and I hope to get used to the taste!!		
uk	been lookin for ages for this it was a present and recipitant was really pleased with the product good service to well wrapped		
uk	A little known and absolutley delicious drink with real medicinal properties.I first came across it as a reliable hang-over cure many years ago		
uk	This is my families 'cure-all' first discovered in Italy in the 1950s. Never fails to cure indigestion and with hot water and lemon helps ease most tummy upsets. My father claimed it saved his appendix in 1967!	lemonfat hot	
uk	Saw this advertised on tv, remembered a foreign visitor liked it and was over visiting. He was very pleased and surprised to be given it.		
uk	"Love this Lillet white wine liqueur. Great value here on amazon currently at £12.75......it was selling for £15 in the high st....if you could find it!!! And...free postage :) Must be served very chilled....if you find it a tad ""syrupy"" then put 3 parts with 1 part chilled water. Becareful though, it's not regular wine, it's 17% ! and you may not notice at first lol. Some people serve it with soda water and a thin slice of orange but I prefer it just as it is."	orangethin syrupy	
uk	A sweet wine based apertif from Bordeaux, definitely sweet and the best option to create 007's Vesper Martini		
uk	I'm fairly new to vermouths, I've tried a couple of bad ones, a few okay ones, and one or two good ones. This is the first 'great' vermouth that I've had. First vermouth I'd drink neat, and one that'll become a regular resident of my drinks cabinet. I think it works well for martini's and manhattans, but I'll be trying Lillet rouge out with bourbon sometime to see if it's an even better fit.		
uk	a little expensive for what it is, I guess we have Mr Bond to thank for that...		
uk	Just the thing for making authentic James Bond Vesper martinis! Perfect.		
uk	Very tasty, quality very good just like in a bar. But too expensive like most of the alcohol on amazon if you could find a shop that sell it , it would be probably cheaper there but difficult to find. Otherwise there are lots of other alternatives out there for fraction of the prise in normal supermarkets.		
uk	I only bought it as its part of the james bond drink in casino royale called vesper		
uk	Makes a delicious martini, especially if you want to be James Bond and make a ‘vesper’ al la Casino Royale.		
uk	Gorgeous aperitif served chilled with a slice of orange. On sunny days I can't get enough of it - heck on any day I can't get enough of it!		
uk	An apprecistor for many years- my favourite aperitif!!		
uk	A French charm ermouth.Add a thin slice of orange or lemon peel for that bit of extra nosiness.	orange lemonthin	
uk	Like many others we bought this french wine aperitif in order to make martini vespers. It is superb in a vesper and it is also makes a very nice sweet and fruity drink which is best served well chilled. It keeps really well in the fridge so using it quickly is optional :-)		
uk	Perfect for Vespers, and other cocktails. Classic French Vermouth		
uk	Gorgeous! With ice cube and slice of orange, perfect.		
uk	Extraordinary packaging, almost better than the bottle inside.		
uk	If you're after Vesper ingredients, the Bond Vesper used an old formula Lillet. You're better off with Martini Riserva Speciale Ambrato for something closer but similarly priced to Lillet. Lillet Blanc now is a sweet (not dry) white French vermouth. It's fantastic neat with ice (and/or soda) and also makes for a great Negroni if you swap it for the classic Italian sweet vermouth.		
uk	Lovely medium white vermouth..not dry. Lovely chilled by itself or in a martini. It's great ..		
uk	Got this for my James Bond Martini-makes its taste just like you get in the pubs or clubs.Amazon was the only place I could find it so 5 stars.		
uk	Used it to make vesper Martini's before quickly realising vesper Martini's are bl**dy horrible, and one is about 6 units of alcohol. Disgusting, but great service and delivery. Warning: Do not watch Casino Royale while hammered and next to an internet enabled device.		
uk	Although not the original recipe from James Bond ubiquitous shaken not stirred as the original was more bitter just add a couple of drops of Angustura bitters and it gets pretty close.		
uk	Be warned this is a sweet vermouth. I bought it thinking it was dry		
uk	Warning! This doesn't turn you into James Bond, but it does make a delicious Vespa!		
uk	I'd never heard of this until I decided to make a Vespa martini... Which incidentally taste great. You don't use a lot of it for the martini, which is probably why you would purchase this. However, it's probably a good reason to make lots of them! Tastes great...		
uk	Will be trying this at Xmas as we want to try the vesper martini that James Bond so loves!!!!!		
uk	Made excellent martinis with this. Bit experimental, but very nice, indeed.		
uk	I never bought such a premium wine. Bought it during Christmas on Lightning deal and enjoyed with family		
uk	this vermouth is actually very nice on it's own. Fruity and fresh. For a great martini, splash out on some stolichnaya elit, and hendricks gin. mix 2 part vodka, 2 parts gin and 1 part lillet. Stir or shake, and enjoy. You'll feel like bond in no time, because you'll be tipsy :)		
uk	Different and refreshing to most vermouths, very little known have only seen it in one other house and have never looked for it in a bar or hotel, perhaps it should be better publicised.		
uk	"Fast delivery and nice ""vermouth"", classic for the cocktail cabinet"		
uk	Lillet did meet my expectations. I did miss the bitter part of it and used some drops of Angostura in my cocktail and worked out fine. Still don't understand why they changed the original recipe though. Only point is that I know quite a number of aromatic white wines pretty similar to Lillet and sure they'd do the trick roughly the same way...plus they are pretty easier to find. Good product. Thumb up.		
uk	"very nice chilled on its own, a bit different however as part of the James bond "" Vespa Martini"" absolutely magnificent. Highly recommended."		
uk	Excellent - exactly what I wanted for a particular cocktail.		
uk	Now almost impossible to buy except on line. I used to drink it at Duke's Hotel in the 60s		
uk	Product was delivered on time, and given as a gift. Recipient of the gift was delighted, therefore I've no complaints		
uk	Just the stuff for a Vesper Martini (James Bond style).		
uk	A superb summer drink topped up with good quality lemonade and ice my top tip is to serve really cold over ice		
uk	1) Fill glass with loads of ice 2) Fill glass with loads of Lillet 3) Stir ice for about 5-10 seconds 4) Proceed to drink the rest of the bottle in this manner		
uk	As per Casino Royale - this is an essential modern day equivalent of Lillet Blanc used in the 'Vesper' cocktail!		
uk	Great for those Vesper Martinis!! Lovely taste, a great addition to anyone's drinks cabinet who is looking for something a bit different		
uk	This is one of my favourite drinks and quite hard to find in the UK. Very happy to have found it here.		
uk	Bought to make cocktails as we had a cocktail evening. The product took quite a long time to arrive but came in time in the end, very well packaged was a bit worried as had not purchased bottles on line before but would do so again. Tastes a bit like Martini, great for james bond cocktails		
uk	I bought it to make a Vesper, as it's said to be the closest thing you can get to Kina Lillet. The Vespers I've made with it are fabulous. Well done, James!		
uk	If you are a James Bond fan, a martini fan, then this is the product for you to try...... enjoy		
uk	"Bought it for the 007 inspired cocktail ""Vespa"". Good quality and did the trick. Not tried any other variation yet other than neat which was very pleasant."		
uk	I agree entirely with the other reviewer. It is a shame that this cannot be bought on a high street or from a big seller shop. Has a very lovely orange hint. Well worth the effort for a great Martini.		
uk	You can't make a Vespa Martini without it! For all those James Bond anoraks this is a must. Tried all my favourite haunts to get this and eventually got some and boy, I wasn't disappointed. Haven't used it for any other drink yet but am sure it does the job well, lovely silky vermouth with a hint of 'pow'.		
uk	Unfortunately our bottle was corked and undrinkable. It was very nice in casseroles though		port
uk	Great for a few pre Christmas day mornings, nice...		port
uk	one of my favourite tipples, sadly my wife likes it with lemonade.		port
uk	Delicious port. Nice peppery finish. Good winter drink.		port
uk	This is by far the most superior port and velvet smooth on the mouth and throat but the price on Amazon is £8 more than in Asda and £10 more than Aldi when they have it and it tastes even better if you let it breathe a little while before drinking this should be the benchmark by which all port is measured		port
uk	what a buy lovely port, well packaged too, many thanks		port
uk	Just cannot be beaten. On it's own or mixed with lemonade, so good!!		port
uk	Arrived on time and enjoyed by my 102 year old Uncle !		port
uk	Ok its not vintage, but if you need to buy some Port for someone that does not know their Vintage Port's from their LBV's. This will do great.		port
uk	I cannot tell you how much i love this stuff!!! I'm coeliac so am not able to drink Baileys anymore and i can honestly say this is the closest thing i can find taste wise. Whilst a tad on the pricey side it is well worth it...so much so we drank 3 bottles in one night! (be careful its 15%!!!) This would make a lovely gift to put in a hamper or to take to a dinner party, i will definitely be buying more!!!		
uk	I was introduced to this by a friend. I can't only have a glass of this though once the bottle is opened i am afraid it's gone before I notice. I love it. I am no lover of Red Wine it's awful. This wine is the only wine i will drink. Highly recommend you try it at least once in your life. :)		
uk	The best chocolate wine that money can buy! I've been purchasing Rubis Chocolate Wine as a gift for my partner ever since she brought home a bottle from the BBC Gardener's World and Good Food Show back in 2013. She loves it. :-)		
uk	It's all a matter of taste but smells lovely and tastes great makes an unusual gift if you manage to not drink it yourself ...enjoy. Personally I had tried this elsewhere and was pleased to see it available on here as usually supplier has shut down so bought for own use.		
uk	I bought this as a gift for my aunt who loves chocolate but does not like red wine. She said it was to die for, the nicest drink she has had for a long time. I have also had a bottle of this and can confirm its absolutely divine.		
uk	I bought this wine for a friend. The service was quick & it was well packed. I have had this wine bought for me as a present & it is very rich a very nice treat well worth the money.I would buy it again.		
uk	Love this stuff! Not too sickly despite being sweet and I didn't find it thick or syrupy. Lovely dessert beverage. I would buy it again.		
uk	I would say it tastes more like a liquor, rather than wine, and I personally could not have more than a glass, as it is very very sweet. But it is a great gift, the bottle looks very elegant. Great for chocolate lovers.		
uk	This stuff is delicious - we were served it in a local high-end gastro pub and made a note of the name as everyone was blown away by it.		
uk	As previous reviews have reported, this is delicious even if the combination seems wierd. Even my boyfriend, for whom it was a risky present as he doesn't like strange things, liked it. Try it!		
uk	Didn't fancy drinking this but was very pleasantly surprised. Perfect as a dessert wine especially when served with profiteroles. Great as a gimmick present that actually tastes good.		
uk	lovely if you like chocolate ive tryed chocolate shop wine but i find it a little watery in taste this is so much better second bottle :-)		
uk	No box! Just a bottle. I don't drink boxes and I've bought it for myself anyways, so.. And technically it's a liquor, not wine, but oh, girl it's delicious! I might be buying more of these very soon.		
uk	Once you take your first sip, it will change into a gulp, and you will drink it like water. 15% alcohol, quite low for a fortified wine, but will keep and the stopper is one that suggests it will keep. Be warned, this is extremely more-ish! Ampers.		
uk	Odd one. Very similar to what I expected from the reviews I read. It slips down quite easily and is very sweet, as people have said, more like a fortified wine like port or sherry than a true wine. packs a reasonable kick, but my husband and I had one glass each last night and it's more than half gone :( the chocolatey taste is not sickly and the wine is not thick or like a liqueur. Will I buy it again? Might just have a glass of normal wine and some chocolate separately, but it is very drinkable.		
uk	Agree with the other reviews who say this is fantastic. It's REALLY hard to have just one glass!!		
uk	Didn't taste any but I came quickly and looks like a high quality bottle		
uk	I don't like sweet wines, however a little of this was surprisingly pleasant and there's definitely a chocolate after-taste. Sounds strange, but very nice.		
uk	If you like chocolate ( who doesn't ?) and you like a good red wine .. this is the perfect combination.. it's delicious!		
uk	Wasnt for me - was very rich almost like a liqueur. Acquired taste maybe?		
uk	Tasty but quite expensive to be honest. Bought it as a birthday present last year and again this year because it was well received!		
uk	Been bringing this to the last few Christmas parties, and its always a popular alternative to normal red and white.		
uk	Great if you haven't tried this drink and you love chocolate you will not be disappointed,		
uk	This is lovely wine but don't be fooled by the picture - it does not arrive with a gift box.		
uk	arrived promptly , lovely box , can't comment on wine as bought for a raffle prize and so I haven't tried it !		
uk	This works, surprisingly well, lovely for winters evenings.		
uk	This was purchased as a present and therefore I can't comment on the actual taste of the wine but I think it's worth mentioning that the bottle was not supplied in the gift box shown in the picture - which I feel is slightly misleading.		
uk	So much for amazon prime it took 4 days to arrive No presentation box either just a cardboard box... and it's a bit expensive but if you like it then you have to pay the price... I suppose it's fairly nice		
uk	Much nicer than it sounds. More fruity over ice. Nice after a meal. Port like.		
uk	I did not like the taste but it looks nice and would suit as a gift to someone eho might does.		
uk	!!Super fast!! DELIVERY Great present for any wine / chocolate lover such a smooth rich taste		
uk	I love this and I shall be buying it for my sister at Christmas and of course one for myself.		
uk	very smooth, but can buy same quality from local store for cheaper price, but nice		
uk	Wow, wonderful if you like port and chocolate. Great flavour. Worth every penny.		
uk	So sweet and calm,I almost turn to alcoholic but not taking it long anymore.it suppose to name temptation.		
uk	Beautiful drink, red wine / chocolate mix, smooth yet light. Extremely moreish!		
uk	Bought for my wine and chocolate connoisseur brother-in-law, it arrived very well packaged, on time, and, more importantly, he loved it.		
uk	It's a confusing, mind-boggling wine. But delicious. Great with chocolate for that extra chocolatey experience		
uk	Well she drank it all........ seemed to go down well. Great combination of tastes		
uk	Desert or fortified wine style. Strong chocolate flavour.		
uk	unusual really tasty wine and is exactly how it is described, would definitely buy it again although it is a bit expensive but very nice for a treat.		
uk	Tried this wine at a christmas market and wanted to get some for christmas, glad I did would recommend this for any chocolate conissour. A red dessert wine that is best drank when chilled.		
uk	We tasted this 3 years ago and it had a more intense chocolate flavour than it has now. Rubis must have changed its dosage since		
uk	I super gift NB consistency and colour is that of a wine and not a sauce.		
uk	This product arrived without the box! Really disappointed as had bought two for gifts. The wine is lovely.		
uk	bought this as a gift and I'm told it's 'Mmmmmmmmmm.........' :-)		
uk	This is the nectar of the gods ! Chocolate and wine ! What more could you want ? Maybe Josh Hartnett serving it to you ? Two out of three ain't bad !		
uk	Love Rubis wine and very few places sell it. Ax on is a very useful outlet. Received when promised and kept informed of delivery progress since the order was placed.		
uk	My fave wine! Only other place I can seem to get it is blue water... but I've not seen the stool, By far the nicest wine I've ever had.		
uk	My Wife adores this, usually get her one for Chrimbo. A classy alternative to Bailey's.		
uk	I love Rubis and decided to buy these as gifts however I was disappointed that there was no box/giftbox as shown on the picture. Whenever I have bought them elsewhere they have always had the Rubis Gift box.		
uk	This wine tastes great. It's a delicate red wine based on Rioja with chocolate flavour which is very subtle and not overpowering. Great treat after a long day.		
uk	Love this wine but very difficult to get hold of. quick delivery too.		
uk	Lovely wine. I would not have thought I would enjoy a chocolate flavoured wine but it's now my favourite wine.		
uk	Great wine, speedy delivery - well rwcieved present.		
uk	Christmas present for a friend, no problems whatsoever with this order.		
uk	Bought as a Christmas present for my mom, she loved it		
uk	Haven't tried it as of yet but my mum has. Apparently it's a quenching drink after a meal. I will certainly have some		
uk	Bought it for my Mother to enjoy on her holiday and she said it was lovely.		
uk	Bought this as a gift. The receiver really liked it. Happy with this product.		
uk	Beautiful wine chocolate and cinnamon excellent dessert wine	cinnamonchocolate	
uk	Arrived very quickly. Really nice wine, it's lovely.		
uk	This is an acquired taste - I have acquired it. Smooth and sweet, this is an excellent dessert wine but not for the purist.		
uk	Hubbie absolutely loved it - bought again as present for another red wine lover		
uk	Love this wine, it's like a big hug on a cold night		
uk	I tried Rubis Chocolate at a wine tasting today and fell in love. It has a gorgeously rich chocolately taste that doesn't overpower the wine all. I enjoyed this so much I bought a bottle straight away (at a cheaper price of £10.99). Previous reviews have suggested pouring the wine over ice-cream, this sounds like a wonderful idea and I can't wait to try it.		
uk	Two sips and I was clapping my hands like a seal at the zoo. Fine on its own but goes down better dressed in women's clothing with accessorised heavy black mascara (smeared).		
uk	Being quite a fan of both chocolate and red wine, I thought I'd give this a go after seeing just how many 5* reviews it had. How glad I am!! I took a bottle with me for an after-dinner drink with the family after a sunday roast. It went down an absolute treat. The closest thing I can compare it to is Baileys, but I personally prefer it to Baileys. It is a really deep chocolate flavour, not too sweet, and is perfect at room temperature. It says it can be tried with a glass and ice but it was gone before we could experiment. We had it in double shot glasses and I'd say that is the perfect amount. You don't drink the same amount you would red wine as it would get sickly. Also at only just under £15 (or £12 if buy as a pair as sold on Amazon) it makes a perfect present for just about anyone. Given a couple as gifts and the praise back is always overwhelming with them buying some more themselves. Furthermore, it is well presented in its own box, so looks a little fancy as well. Overall, I strongly recommend it!!		
uk	I'm not a huge wine lover, particularly red wine however I have a sweet tooth and love chocolate. I saw this by chance when looking at something else for a Christmas present and decided to give this a go for myself. . Don't expect a chocolate flavour wine as you would chocolate flavour milk! This is a very sweet red wine with a chocolate after-taste infusion. It's really lovely ONCE you understand what it is. I shall be buying some again for sure. Well worth the money.		
uk	Bought this for four family members and myself during Christmas, and it went down well. We ran out! Delicious! Two bottle will be purchased next time.		
uk	This is absolutely disgusting. I don't understand how so many people appear to think this is nice, but I find it vile.		
uk	I don't drink alcohol so haven't tried this but based on my bfs auntie and uncle, this wine is extremely tastey and well worth the money. It's really sweet according to them so it lasts a long time. In fact, they liked it so much that they bought another two bottles of it. We also bought them it for Christmas last year too. We had originally bought it for Christmas 2013 but I just haven't made a review until now. My apologies. Based on their reviews, I highly recommend this product.		
uk	I gave it to my parents and they loved it. Would recommend it.		
uk	Yummy. A favourite tipple. Came quickly and well packed		
uk	This is very good. Unexpected smooth chocolatey taste, and it makes you feel a nice buzz when drinking it. Would buy again.		
uk	I chose this as a slightly funny gift for the wife who loves both wine and chocolate... It didn't let me down and it far exceeded my expectations... The bottle looks very classy, making it a much nicer gift than was originally intended. The chocolate wine itself was absolutely divine. It had the consistency of a smooth wine with a magical chocolate scent and aftertaste... It was luxurious... We drank the whole bottle on Christmas day and I wished I had more... I would whole-heartedly recommended this to any wine/chocolate lover, and I will definitely be buying some more... This product is so under recognised... If I could it rate it any higher I would, but five stars will have to do. I have a new favourite thing, Rubis Chocolate Wine is simply amazing...		
uk	Very sweet. The after taste is most enjoyable. Took me ages to finish my first glass. Have not had another since. Ill try it again at christmas in a smaller glass.		
uk	Each to their own, but not my thing, not my thing on a relatively startling scale. Amazon please stop suggesting a buy this again.		
uk	Bought as a present. Recipients loved it and said it was a different taste to any thing they had before.		
uk	Bought this as a present for my wife, but she let me try some. I wasn't sure if I'd like it but actually it's quite nice. However, it's not wine, per se. It's *made from* wine, like port. And port is what it most closely resembles: ruby port, as alluded to by the name. And as such, it's definitely a dessert drink, although it's less strong than your typical fortified wine. Some might see that as a good thing. The flavour is balanced, with the chocolate complementing the grape very well. In the end though, I've always preferred a well aged tawny port, and the result is a touch too sweet for my palate. I'd not buy it again for myself, but my wife likes it.		
uk	I tried this at a food festival yesterday and half expected it to be sickly sweet or red winey....I was wrong. The first mouthful is a shock to the system, in a great way! It's smooth, deep, there's no bitter after taste, it's not sugary. The chocolate is rich and dark. It's a funny experience watching friends and family taste it also. I've bought 5 bottles in 2 days! I'm hooked already. A must try!		
uk	A wonderful combination of quality fruity red wine and dark choc. Very easy to drink, you have been warned !!! Nice warm or chilled on its own as a tipple or as a dessert wine - also nice added to choc mousse or any other sweet where you might use sherry or rum for example.		
uk	This is wonderful I love this bottle of Chocolate wine it will impress all your guests if you are having a dinner party.		
uk	The only thing I can say about this Wine is try it you will be surprised by how nice it is, not too chocolatey or strong alcohol tasting. Biggest problem is trying not to drink the whole bottle in one night.		
uk	As all way amazon deliver, was a good price and just what I was looking for. If anyone is looking for a great tasting chocolate wine then this is the one to get.		
uk	Two of my favourite things combined ... chocolate and wine!! Rubis chocolate wine contains the right balance of both of these ingredients to create a soft, warm and aromatic taste sensation. It is quite rich and works perfectly as a desert wine. I usually serve it in shot glasses to be sipped which i've found to be a very palatable.		
uk	Haven't taste it myself unfortunately. offered it for present. But I am curious and if I do no hear soon from it I will order one for myself, I am very inquisitive about it		
uk	i love this splendid christmassy drink, we tried it many years ago but sadly it cannot be found on the off licence shelves anymore,indulgent,luxurious and im worth it		
uk	I purchased this wine for my girlfriend as she loves anything chocolately, but was expecting it to be very creamy and sickly. however, when the wine arrived, both me and my girlfriend loved it, it is not at all sickly and really does taste like chocolate wine! very drinkable!		
uk	I will start by saying that i love this. Now that doesn't mean much because I don't like red wine at all and I only like a couple of white wines (White Zinfandel mainly). In my opinion this is more of a liqueur, nearer Tia Maria than Bordeaux. As I say, I am no expert but I really like it.		
uk	I tried this at the Good Food Show and was an immediate convert. I've been looking for a dessert wine for ages and this is perfect.		
uk	"When I ordered John Michael Greer's book ""The UFO Phenomenon"" from Amazon.com.uk, I got a £ 40 wine voucher as a special offer. There's just one problem. I don't drink. The whole thing made me feel like a UFO..."		
uk	A bit thick but enjoyed it with friend who has also bought it, would buy it again but found it a bit pricey		
uk	A Deliciously Warm and velvety smooth wine that just slides down the throat. Smells and tastes absolutely devine mmm :-)		
uk	The classic French Dry White Vermouth, great chilled on its own over ice or with a your mixer of choice and invaluable to wet the glass of a classic Martini cocktail		
uk	A great all rounder. Be careful with this if it's your first time as the taste is quite strong but it's a wonderful mixer to have in the cupboard and it's usually at a great price on Amazon. Don't be worried about the packaging. It's carefully boxed and I've never had problems.		
uk	I'm not quite sure how much I can write about dry vermouth. The Noilly Prat product is good but I can't help thinking it is a little expensive. That said, it is a quality product and you can't get much better for the purpose of cocktails. Ultimately, if you want a good vermouth and a reasonably acceptable price, you should probably buy it.		
uk	Perfect for Martinis. I used to use Cocchi Americano, but have developed a preference for Noilly Prat. Also good instead of white wine in sauces for fish. Shipped quickly and was well packaged in a very strong discreet cardboard box.		
uk	Noilly Prat is one of the best vermouth around. Love it, fabulous in a Vodka Martini with Grey Goose for a sophisticated drink. Also great in cooking. It is a dry vermouth. Love it! Great fast delivery from this company.		
uk	A nice dry vermouth, that is special with gin etc. Dry, but special. I use it too with pasta sauces etc. I have been buying this for years. Great.		
uk	the best vermouth I've tried. Im no expert but i enjoy it in a martini		
uk	The ONLY Vermouth to have with a Martini. Good value here too - less than any supermarket by about 4 quid.		
uk	"If you like a gin martini try this instead of the ""Martiny"" brand, adds extra layers"		
uk	My husband and I are rather partial to a dry martini and our friends tend to think that we have a ridiculously large gin selection to support this habit. It isn't just about the gin though. A good martini needs the right vermouth to go with it. Noilly Pratt has a lot more flavour than the martini and own brand vermouths that we also buy and is the perfect accompaniment to the majority of the gins in our collection and as such I would highly recommend it. However there are occasions when one of the other options is better as the Noilly Pratt can sometimes mask the flavour of the gin. If you are looking for a good all rounder though I would suggest that this French vermouth is the one to choose. It does spoil in time so a smaller bottle may be a better option if you don't plan to use it very often. It is worth noting that it also works well in cooking.		
uk	I'm not a regular drinker of things like vermouth (or the cocktails it's associated with) however I wanted to purchase a bottle to cover the festive period and having done so I indulged a little bit... It's lovely, tastes really pleasant on its own and is great in a martini (tried it with both vodka and gin) I also used it to make a Manhattan (50/50 this and dubonnet + rye and bitters of course) and it was fabulous, highly recommended		
uk	Proper Vermouth, everything else is imitation. This is the Vermouth of choice at all the top Cocktail bars, keep it in the fridge to keep it nice an cold.		
uk	I wouldn't buy it if I didn't like it! It would be helpful if your courier UPS would indicate more precisely when they can deliver ie morning or afternoon; or, like DPD, give an hour slot.		
uk	"If you see the word ""Vermouth"" and think ""Chinzano"" or ""Martini"", then you have been missing out. Noilly Pratt is French vermouth, whereas the others are Italian and no where near as nice. NP is just delicious. It is an aromatic dry fortified wine, rich and lush with spices and woody flavours. It's great straight on the rocks, it makes the best Martini (cocktail), or Gin & It (equal quantities of gin and NP). It is fantastic to cook with, going particularly well with seafood. If you have never tried it, I recommend giving it a go on the rocks. I always keep a bottle in the cupboard and can definitely recommend it to others."		
uk	For a good dry martini, Noilly is an absolute must - vermouth at it's very best. It is crisp, dry and flavoursome - very clean on the palate. I always try to keep this in the drinks fridge just in case!		
uk	Very quick delivery and perfect vermouth for cocktails		
uk	Superb tawny. A lot nicer than their 20 y/o offering. I wish they done this is larger bottles, it just doesn't last! It has a rich, honey-like sweetness with lots of dried fruits. Somewhat minty notes too... Try it!		port
uk	Bought for a gift---the recipients were very pleased		port
uk	Delicious tawny port! Had it over Christmas instead of a pudding wine, went down great.		port
uk	this delicous port was a present ,and the taste is exact the same as a good quality Dutch[alcohol] cherry filled chocolate [kersen-bonbon], and with christmasin mind,this port ad to cherries with icecream must taste lovely.	cherrychocolate	port
uk	Amazing port, if you like tawny port look no further, would make a great gift too.		port
uk	A xmas gift for my son, he loves it, I wish I had bought the bigger bottle. again next year. Bought through Amazon.		port
uk	Last Christmas I was lucky enough to enjoy a bottle of this excellent Port. Light with delicious overtones of Oranges and Caramel, it is best served chilled. Possibly even over ice. Yes really. This Port is different and delightful.		port
uk	An excellent substitute for anyone wishing to dodge the alcohol. I’ve tried many non-alcoholic drinks including the Seedlip drinks and this one is one of the best. It is also very good value for money.		
uk	Stunning alcohol free alternative to Vermouth. Easy to drink neat as an appetiser with no unpleasant lingering after taste, also very nice mixed with a touch of lemonade with ice. Has a wonderful smell too. Can highly recommend picking up a bottle, I don't think you'll be disappointed.		
uk	Tastes really good (not like those fake wines) and looks just like the real thing, all grown up, will order it again some time!!		
uk	This is a really lovely non-alcoholic drink, smells and tastes just like vermouth. I absolutely love it and makes a nice refreshing drink for us abstainers!		
uk	Tastes just like a normal vermouth,would recommend this to everyone, a must in your drinks cabinet. Over ice with a slice,lemonade or tonic a guilt free pleasure.		
uk	Tried to be good but I really didn't like the taste. Very bitter.		
uk	"Bought this for ""dry"" January and it is so good I have bought two more bottles for a ""free from"" February. Great with lemonade or tonic water and a few mls of Monin Gin flavour syrup makes it super-good. It has a great authentic vermouth taste. I didn't feel deprived at all."		
uk	Excellent adult non alcoholic drink. Great with tonic ice and a slice		
uk	Cracking addition to my alcohol free drinks cabinet		
uk	Brilliant grown up drink, full of flavour not too sweet, best with a mixer like lemonade or tonic water. Love it.		
uk	"Bought as an alternative to alcoholic long drink whilst off the booze for a while. Pleasant when mixed with tonic. Not sure this would be my ""go to"" drink, but nice enough. Not a massive fan of Vermouth anyway, so probably not the best judge of taste but certainly worth trying. Cheaper than some ""artisan"" type alcohol-free mixers."		
uk	Please bring it back. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was difficult finding distributors in the UK.		
uk	Excellent product as described & well boxed to ensure safe delivery		
uk	Fabulous traditional Martini Rosso bottle - perfect for Negroni and many more Italian classics		
uk	What can one say about Martini Rossi apart that I like it.		
uk	My wife enjoys it and its handy to have for a few cocktails.		
uk	My girlfriends Wife really enjoyed it. Good last minute choice.		
uk	have been drinking martini for 60 years nothing more to say		
uk	I love martini, what can i say?!?! perfect for cocktails or just with an orange inside. amazing aperitivo or after dinner drink		
uk	Look at any sweet vermouth comparison taste-test and Martini Rosso is always in the top five if not three. It's a cocktail bar essential. It's not the best sweet vermouth out there but it's up there and it's a brilliant all-rounder that undercuts it's peers by a third in price. Try it next to a supermarket own-brand - which are usually only a couple of pounds less - and you'll notice a big difference. You won't go back I assure you. Good enough to drink on it's own with ice or with soda and the quality of your cocktails will go up a few notches too.		
uk	Get my wife tipsy and tastes good... Government would only rate this 1 star now though, I disagree!		
uk	I thought this looked like a decent price having done only a small amount of research. Sadly, a recent visit to my local Sainsbury's told me otherwise! They have a 1 litre bottle for £11.50.		
uk	Fantastic Value! Ideal gift, especially for Christmas - certainly, I always think of it as a Christmas drink anyway; also tastes amazing.		
uk	Was missing madeira and this fulfills that requirement perfectly.		
uk	I bought this for use in a recipe for a New Year's dinner and I wasn't disappointed - with the recipe or this rich and warm drink. There was plenty left for a glass or two after I'd made the meal, and I'll most definitely be buying Madeira again.		
uk	THIS MADEIRA IS VERY VERY SWEET AND FRUITY. I CAN ONLY DRINK IT WITH LEMONADE OR SPARKLING WATER. BUT A LOVELY TASTE.		
uk	Love it, but sadly price DOUBLED after the first few we bought. Not worth £18.		
uk	After a recent holiday in Madeira....what can I say		
uk	Great for venison and beef recipes as a treat. Also as a warming celebration drink		
uk	no more to say than this madeira hits all the right notes excellent taste and value for money.		
uk	My husband lo es this.we went on holiday where they make this and it is great. Its nine euro on Island.but £12 here.		
uk	Lovely madeira - one of my all-time favourites. Great price, too!		
uk	Gift for a retirment present, much appreciated by recipient		
uk	Cheaper version of a very acceptable Madeira. Case of six enjoyed by a friend and self. A define re-order in future.		
uk	Was actually delivered to a friend, who reckoned was a nice smooth drink and arrived in plenty of time for christmas		
uk	Love this, first bought in Madeira. Good price will buy again		
uk	I've done this and Blandy's run a superb facility in Funchal where you can try all their products. Well worth the trip		
uk	I loved this rich sweet madeira so much I bought another six bottles up to now.		
uk	"It's worth noting that this product is actually not a Malmsey, as it's made from the Tinta Negra grape as opposed to the Malmsey (or Malvasia) variety. This is the ""entry"" level wine and is aged for 3 years. That doesn't detract from how pleasant this wine is, but it's not the same as an aged Malmsey and especially unlike a vintage. For more information: http://www.wine-pages.com/features/blandys-madeira.htm"		
uk	Started drinking this whilst watching the GE results. At least it brought a little bit of entertainment to the evening.		
uk	this is the finest Madeira you can drink, its far too good for cooking with, but I must admit I have done, and got rave reviews from my friends too. this is the best of the best as far as I am concerned.		
uk	Delivered quickly and well packed in boxes just right for wrapping as present, She has let me have a small ,very small,, and its great, sort of cross between a liquor and sherry/		
uk	Purchased as a historical taster really, it is mentioned in all sorts of places and I deduced that the flavour would be much the same as during it's early invention and, even if it is not, it is still a very nice drink, taken a little like a Port or a Cream Sherry would be imbibed, very nice and pleasing to the discerning drinker, excellent....		
uk	Repeated order. As described. Excellent used in venison cooking.		
uk	"Lindisfarne Mead is one of the best meads there is. It's still made on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, and it's definitely a classic, unique, and instantly recognisable taste. It's light, and very enjoyable to drink. That said, it's actually not as honey rich as some other meads, being a slightly more wine-centric flavour with some extra spices over a ""pure"" traditional mead. If you're expecting a heavy, Scandinavian taste, you might be left a little disappointed by the flavour of this offering. However, it tastes like it always used to!"	honeyrich heavy light	
uk	I bought this after hearing about mead and how it was made. Was doing some research on it and came across the website of Lindisfarne. This was my first taste of mead and it was beautiful, smooth and slightly sweet. I'm annoyed that I didn't find this wonderful drink sooner.		
uk	Honestly tastes very little like mead, nothing like an actual honey mead tastes likes white wine with lots of sugar. It still tastes alright but not the choice if you're going for mead.	honeythin	
uk	I'm no connoisseur of mead, so cannot possibly compare it to other available meads. If you are however looking for something different and like sweet drinks, this a good find in my opinion I will drink goldschlager, peach schnapps, sherry etc., for example. So if that's along the lines of your taste palette, give this a try.	peachthin sweet	
uk	Good, arrived very well packaged. Have had tastier mead but this is close. Would recommend. Nice gift		
uk	Nice drink. As we visited the area once wanted to try it. Not too strong and lovely.		
uk	Very prompt delivery, well packaged. Will make an excellent Christmas present. 10/10.		
uk	My husband used to buy this for me many years ago when on holiday in the Scottish Borders and it is still wonderful		
uk	A taste of Lindisfarne, brought this as a replacement for the one from last years holiday. It tastes just as good.		
uk	Delivered in a brilliant anti-smash wrapper. Tastes delicious. Good Price.		
uk	Amazing balance of flavour and strength. Many thanks, thelink2money.com		
uk	Delightful drop from my home county. His was a gift for someone but I was allowed some too. Not too sweet, with a nice warming feeling.		
uk	One of the best meads ever tasted will definitely be ordering more		
uk	Arrived on time (I'm with Prime). This is a great Mead and one I have had before, would recommend this.		
uk	Package arrived well packed and on time :) My fav mead wine!		
uk	This is a fantastic drink and well worth the money.		
uk	Price a bit excessive but makes a change to the standard Christmas booze. Gave as a gift and was much appreciated.		
uk	The service was very good, but the postage was expensive. As for the product, if your a lover of mead I am sure you will love it. I have bought a few bottles over the years with the intention of keeping it for Christmas.........we i thought about it, but that was as far as it got as by the time Christmas came.....i ended up replacing it. I have done this routine for the past few years now, so why spoil a good thing......lovely drink		
uk	I regret to say that I am disappointed with the product. It tastes like white wine with sugar added and quite unlike the Lindisfarne mead that I bought on Holy Island from the shop there. That mead had a rich honey taste, a thicker consistency and warmed the insides as it went down - quite unlike this insipid liquid. I shall not purchase any more. Rather I shall try a Cornish mead.	honeyrich	
uk	I bought a bottle of this when I actually visited Lindisfarne and its absolutely beautiful. It's a bit like a sherry but without the harsh after taste. Its also beautifully warming - a great sore throat cure. Having moved to Spain, I've also tried it over ice as an after dinner drink and was deliciously refreshing. I am also delighted that I can mail order it - yum!		
uk	As always -Lindisfarne Mead is the very best. Tried others but always returned! Shan't bother to try others any more!!		
uk	This was a present for someone so unable to give any comment		
uk	what i got was a nasty sharp tasting white wine with no colour and doesnt taste of much honey not impressed	honeysharp	
uk	I visited Lindisfarne at the weekend and actually bought two of these in the shop for £16. I tasted it before bought it - a very sweet, strong tasting wine. I feel disappointed reading on the internet that it's actually a fruit wine blended with honey, feeling I have missed out on tasting the traditional drink. If I had known this, I probably wouldn't have bought the bottles in the shop. However, it doesn't taste like poison as the drama queen negative reviewer claimed.	honeysweet strong	
uk	We bought 2 bottles and we're very dissapointed. It's ok, but certainly more honied wine than mead which is not as described. We used the remains of tbe first bottle to make mulled wine and gave the second bottle away. It's probably ok if you like sherry or don't know what mead should taste like, but seeing as real mead is the same price.......		
uk	Simply the best there is, I've been drinking this nearly 40 years, recommended		
uk	Lindisfarne mead is the best mead you will ever taste!		
uk	It's a nice drink, but don't be fooled this is a MEAD WINE, it is not a pure mead. If you are looking for a pure mead, avoid this. If you like wine and honey, you will love this.		
uk	First tried this on holiday in Berwick-Upon-Tweed. Lovely stuff. So glad I can buy on here as I can't get it in the shops anywhere else		
uk	My mother who is eighty years old loves this product, it makes a change from her glass of sherry on a sunday!		
uk	The mead is lovely but a 50% mark up over the rrp seems a bit much.		
uk	I don't know what the guy who wrote the 1 star review is on about, this stuff is gorgeous, slightly more subtle than other mead's I've had but that makes it easier to drink and means the sugar doesn't doesn't bite you in the back of the throat. It most certainly does not taste like soap.		
uk	Rich, lightly spiced, and enjoyable at all temperatures: I can't fault this drink on flavor. However (as much as I hate to agree with the overthetop negative review) this is not really mead, but a blend of white wine and honey. This is not made very apparent, and in exporting the product to the US they've actually had to legally change the name! You may or may not care about this, but as a budding home-meadmaker I'd hoped to try a traditional mead, not a wine, and was disappointed having paid a lot for it. But as I say, I can't fault the taste. The price does reflect the taste though hence a three star review overall.	honeyflavor rich tar light	
uk	There should be a standard of what you can call mead. This stuff's just fortified white wine with a little honey in for flavour, like the tourist crap you get down in the touristy bits of Cornwall. Pay the extra and get the Danish stuff.		
uk	I think the 1 star review is actually valid if you are after real mead! I got this in a shop near Lindisfarne and the pale colour should have been my first indicator that this is definitely not a proper mead. It is merely a palatable white wine with the tiniest hint of honey and nothing like the liquid honey goodness of the proper drink. The low rating I have given is not to say the drink is disgusting, but to highlight that this should not really be labelled as mead and should be avoided by those after the genuine article. I'm actually about to get some Moniack mead to sample for the first time, so fingers crossed that is the real deal.	honey honeythin tar light	
uk	This product is good if you like the idea of drinking white wine with just a hint of honey. It is not however, mead. Personally I cannot stand white wine so it's fair to say I was very dissapointed.		
uk	I know lindesfarm mead and I I recommend it highly. However. . Thia company fails at all hurdles. The mead has yet to be delivered. I have contacted them to enquire as ti where it may be.. a short e-mail back and forth resulted in them offering to re send the product.. THIS WAS OVER 6 WEEKS AGO... and as tet I have seen nor heard anything. Frankly it would have been quicker to walk to the monastery and buy my own. So yes.. buy the mead. But not from these people.. Mat		
uk	this is one of the best mead's i have ever tasted so im not sure were the prev comment is coming from perhaps he did not wash the glass out 1st? my family have been drinking mead from the holiday island of Lindisfarn the only one made on the island for over 40 years and love it and cant find one better! would recommend any one to buy this product		
uk	Before I started drinking this, I drank other mead type drinks, I was homeless and without a penny to my name. Someone gave me a bottle of this and I've never looked back. I now own a multi national company, pilot a helicopter, hold many strongman titles and have just been voted Britain's most honest man. I've tasted many of these Mead type drinks and like the taste and color of this one the most. My friends can't drink it and complain at the sweet honey taste but I don't mind because it leaves more for me, anyway, they're hopeless no-marks who wouldn't know a nice drink if it got up and told them so. I often go to Lindisfarne, it's where I moor my yacht, and always pop in for a bottle. I couldn't be without Lanchester Mead though, it shifts the muck off of my carburetor.	honeyplain tar sweet tart strong	
uk	"I buy and drink this Mead regularly and felt compelled to write a review having read an UNBELIEVABLE one below. I first found out about this Mead after having watched the programme Countryfile on BBC1. A member of the public was being interviewed and described it as and I quote ""its like angels dancing on my tongue"" and I thought well I'd better try some of that! It is fantastic and a wonderful Mead and I and my family enjoy it regularly so please do not be put off by the other silly comments, I think he had clearly been drinking washing up liquid and not Lindisfarne Mead. Unless his tastebuds recognise honey as detergent!!!"	honeythin	
uk	This stuff is actually fraud, since it is NOT mead at all, but cheap grape wine fortified with honey!!! The taste is sooo vile,that it defies belief! If you want to experience what REAL mead tastes like, try Moniack or Lanchaster. But stay clear of this stuff, unless you like the taste of washing up liquid!		
uk	All drank! I bought this on Amazon because I could not find it in the shops where they constantly told me that it is an outdated drink. I just happen to like it.		
uk	Good product competitively priced (at the time) , too much packaging but fast ship		
uk	My favourite - with next day delivery on prime- need I say more?		
uk	Good value for price was a nice drink mixed with lemonade. The bottle actually is slight bigger than pictured so good.		
uk	Vermouth varieties can be pretty confusing. As is the case here, white doesn't necessarily mean dry. Way back in history Martini Bianco started life as a dry vermouth but was sweetened to end up as more like a halfway house between a dry and a sweet vermouth (Martini 'extra dry' is their dry vermouth expression). If you want a vermouth that has the best of both sweet and dry characteristics then try Martini Bianco. With a dash of bitters and some gin it makes for a lovely, soft, 'just one more' Martini that'll convert anyone who normally finds them too dry.		
uk	I bought this to mix manhattan's with having read that it's great in those, and now having tried it for myself I can verify that it is just that! I'm far from an expert when it comes to drinks such as vermouth, however I will say that I've sampled it on its own too and it's absolutely delicious! Bursting with flavour, frutiness and great depth. A bit of a treat given its price tag however if you're serious about vermouth and are yet to try this then I'd say you definitely should!		
uk	What's not to love? Great vermouth for a fantastic Manhattan.		
uk	My favourite and most delicious kind of vermouth! <3 Makes a mean Manhatten		
uk	A bit pricey but it is worth every penny! Makes THE most awesome Manhattan cocktail with Bulleit Rye whisky... om nom nom. Highly recommend it!		
uk	I have been a fan of Punt-e-mes for some years and now, thanks to an introduction from The Royal Automobile Club, have found something even better.		
uk	I was browsing for a Negroni recipe online and then this site I came across recommended certain brands for the gin / campari / vermouth - this was their most highly rated Vermouth, so thought come on lets give it a try. Now that I have had a few Negroni's since it has arrived I know exactly why. Will buy again no doubt.		
uk	what can i say i am 51 years of age and have not had a drink in 30 years, and since found out having changed my diet for a healthier and prolonged life have discovered some things are actualy good for my body. in certain amounts. and i must say as soon as this hit my taste buds IT WAS HEAVEN. now i hate the taste of alcohol in any form be it spirits or beer's even the smell gives me the shudders, but the the flavour of this is truely amazing. im more worried that i will actualy drink more than i wish too. all i can say is if you like things like this you will be very pleasently supprised, to say i have not had a drink in such a long time i sound like a alcoholic lol. im just gob smacked with the flavour more than the fact its alcohol and if thats what you are looking for rather than its alcohol then treat your taste buds. i have about small shot glass size a day if you add things with your drinks i would say dont do it enjoy the flavour. ok enough waffling RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED FLAVOUR WISE FOR SURE. if you could get this flavour in a none alcoholic drink would be sublime to me		sherry

uk	This is an unbeatable sherry ....... the best. First tried it in the 1950's and it's been a firm favourite ever since. No other sherry comes near it in my opinion. It's opulently smooth and rich with a most beautiful mellow undertone of 'cask' flavour. Disappointing that not all restaurants know of it ........ and they should !		sherry

uk	I love this stuff, I wish it was 1L instead of 75cl.		
uk	"Described as an everyday Port for the vintage Port drinker - er well, give me vintage or a good Tawney every time. I found this Port a bit ""thin"" and bouquet was too alcoholic! No length, no fruitiness, how did this win all awards?"		port
uk	On initial tasting, it was found to be a bit weak and watery, the flavour was fine but lacks a proper port punch.		port
uk	best port I have found at this sort of price great drink		port

uk	Bought to accompany the Christmas pudding on December 25th 2016 and was one of the high points of the meal. Lovely fruity bouquet and huge flavour of sultanas, caramel and spice which stood up to the pudding and complemented it perfectly. Balanced sweetness and acidity that made one want to drink slowly and savour the complex blend of flavours on the palate. A great discovery and a purchase we will repeat.	spicefruity sweet caramel complex	
uk	A really good desert wine, rather like Tokay. A must buy for next Christmas.		
uk	I am no connoisseur but this was recommended by Alex Polizzi on one of her italian documentary s and it was super.		
uk	Great wine, my dad is from Pantelleria so I know it very well. Arrived in the UK in time and in a good packaging. Bit of a small bottle for the price tho.		
uk	great dessert wine, one you have to try to believe that taste, and its dark amber colour, one tried youd never forget		
uk	Excellent, the same as I used to drink in My dear Cadíz		palomino sherry
uk	Vanilla ice cream, fine espresso coffee and this sherry makes a top notch affogato. Well worth a try.	vanilla cream coffeevanilla	sherry

uk	Just love this, bought this wine for my Christmas pudding and it tastes wonderful, very rich in flavour, this is now my favourite desert wine. 100%		sherry
uk	This was suggested to me at a Spanish restaurant as a dessert option. I've never had sherry in my life but ever since trying this one, I've made sure to have a bottle of it at all times. It also makes a great ingredient for any ginger or cinnamon baking!		sherry
uk	Taste is wonderful, would be perfect with Christmas Pudding.		sherry
uk	This is exactly what it says - nectar in a bottle. If you like sweet sherry this is the one. It's very figgy and moreish. I love it.		sherry
uk	I was never one to bother with sherry until I chanced upon a sherry bar in London's King Cross called Bar Pepito : [...] . This Xemenez was their standard offering and loved it instantly for its thick sweetness and indulgent fig taste. Nectar in a bottle.	figtar sweet	sherry
uk	Excellent sweet sherry. Has never let me down in quality in all the time I have been drinking it. Prefer it to many other sweet sherries on the market.		sherry
uk	Worth 5 stars a lovely, complicated PX that took me back to a warm, night in Cordoba, all the nose, spirit and taste of Al Andalus, great wine!!		sherry
uk	I first bought this at a Spanish airport duty free shop. It was such a lovely taste that I hunted around on the internet for more. It is equally ideal as an aperitif or for after a meal but my wife and I choose to enjoy this after our most intimate moments. The Amazon mkt place supplier sent this within 24 hours by a first rate delivery service.		sherry
uk	know this sherry from JEREZ andalusia. smelts a taste of honey,dates, figs and lightly nutty. all in all it is a celebration to enjoy with him ( pedro ximinez ) the sunset. price was ok. but to pay 70 % of the bill for shipping to germany was so frustratin that ive not tasted almost the sherry. excuse my english. my real name is horst piechottka, my english friends.	honeylight hot nutty	sherry
